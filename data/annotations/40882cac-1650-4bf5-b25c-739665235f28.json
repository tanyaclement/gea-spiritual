To have one is not super unusual but it's not that common  either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they're very important  because they tend to color everything else in the chart. "

The T square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit  together. However, X can be anything, Cherrié.

If you do  decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it,  for a while it really does make you feel complete.

It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing? You don't have to go through this.  Are you crazy? What it set up there Cherrie, is this real, almost like this intense self hatred because you felt like, \"I can't believe I did this.
