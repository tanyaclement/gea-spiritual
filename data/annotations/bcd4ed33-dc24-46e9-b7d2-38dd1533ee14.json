For example, it becoming a book and because it's a discard, of really manifesting it, birthing it. What you might need to do is, just maybe center yourself more and clear your mind, and get a little more into a meditative state when you do this work. Because what happens is that, people get a lot of their energy from the upper chakras, cosmic energy, and they don't get enough of the earth energy. Consequently, they're up here in their head, or in the astral up here, and not enough in the body. Because this is a position of your creativity and your receptivity in this earth, it tells me that you might not be getting enough, either you're getting too much or not enough energy from the earth, that you might need to sit on the grass five minutes every day and get energy from the earth, because we're surrounded by concrete.

It's the sun in Sag, in Sagittarius. That means that you have to be very direct in communicating your orders, your messages. Your communication has to be very direct upfront.

There's 9. I've never been able to find the 10th sword in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe swords represent thoughts. Your thoughts are piercing your heart. They're wounding your heart. See the little heart there? With thoughts of ruin, of self-ruin. That has to do with communicating something. Consciously dealing with something. It has to do with the Sun in Gemini. It means that 10 years ago or 10 weeks ago, you were wounded. Probably by somebody else, but you took it up and you beat yourself with it. Situations come up where you think, \"Oh, it's no use. It's futile. It doesn't do any good.\" You do this thought number on yourself.\n\nIf you just will recognize it, that it is just your thoughts. That it is one aspect of yourself and not all of yourself. The hourglass, there's hourglasses here. There's sigils, S-I-G-I-L. They're upside down. Over here is the scales on top. Those are symbols that are pretty much self-explanatory. The hourglass has to do with time. Time running out. You putting a thing on yourself because you didn't do this in time or you didn't do that in time. The scales are like justice and balance and money. It also has to do with money. It's a very simple card. It just means thoughts of self-ruin."
