 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s next year. It&#39;s until next year. It&#39;s not-- Anything that&#39;s going on in the 12th house, especially when it&#39;s near the cusp, it&#39;s a lot. That&#39;s what I was saying. It feels like being premenstrual, sort of. You can almost figure out what&#39;s-- it&#39;s like almost there. Stuff is rumbling around in the background. It&#39;s imminent, this feeling of imminence and of something that is happening and you don&#39;t have very much control over and you can&#39;t really quite figure out.

 <br> It could be good in terms of writing and could be real interesting to just maybe to try and actually focus on using imagery or relying more on imagery that comes from a real subconscious source for a while and playing around with that because there&#39;s a lot of stuff going on on that  level, at the moment, and a lot of flashes.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sí.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It would be nice to do dream work kind of things and just complete free  writing kinds of things, and it&#39;d probably be a really interesting time to try that. In terms of how to deal with it. Anything that has to do with the 12th house, the only way to deal with it is to let go, to be able to let go and let it be. Pay attention, but let it be.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Si. That&#39;s so hard for me to do.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. The 12th house is a hard house. This just has your sun in the 12th house. That is a really difficult place for [inaudible 00:08:07].

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, so is Cherrie&#39;s and Randy&#39;s. Both of them.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s hard.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Plus they have Venus. What else do they have…? [unintelligible]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s interesting. It makes for a potential for a tremendous amount of  compassion, but it&#39;s not easy in terms of figuring out what you want to be doing and how to do it.

Health things are real interesting to look at too. There was like a roommate of mine who had an ulcer, who we figured out. We figured out when it started and looked back in her chart, and it&#39;s these outrageous transits. I mean, all having to do with Cancer, and just the stomach, and Mars things and Saturn. Mars and Saturn and 4th House Cancer stuff. It was just like so clear, and it was incredible.

First of all, possibly some sense of restriction in terms of friendships, feeling like a lack of friends or else possibly a feeling like you want to gather all your friends around you.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sí.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Feeling like you really-- you like, all of a sudden, they&#39;ve become much more precious to you. There&#39;s a little bit of this kind of wanting to conserve your circle.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sí.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: And a sense of the responsibility in terms of what you&#39;re kind of feeling. It just feels a little more weighty than it does usually.

 <br> <strong>Gloria Anzaldúa</strong>: That makes sense.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Your image of how the world fits together and what it all means and that kind of stuff in an intellectualized way is Jupiter, Sag, 9th house stuff.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Because it&#39;s in Cancer, so I want the world to be one big happy family. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, it would be even more so if you had Cancer in the 9th house. I should go on, because the other thing that Jupiter, specifically, as the planet is Jupiter has a lot to do with the kinds of stuff that make you feel very expansive. The kinds of experiences and parts of yourself and activities that make you feel like the world is your oyster and everything is terrific and real-- I don&#39;t know what word I want. Just very at home in the world and grandiose and wonderful and all that stuff.

 <br> It&#39;s interesting. One of my best friends has no fire in her chart whatsoever, and she&#39;s generally very-- She&#39;s earth and water, and is usually real calm and into herself and not real out there in the world. She has a Jupiter in Leo. If you can get her to dance, which is a real trick, you can just watch that all of a sudden that the sense of-- If you can get her into doing something Leo, which is not easy because it clashes very much with her sense of who she is, all of a sudden she&#39;s very--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sí.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Jupiter and Cancer means a lot of that sense of really being at home in the world and everything is fine comes from-- It&#39;s rooted in home stuff, having a homebase, having a real secure environment, and also emotional connectiveness somewhere. If you&#39;re ever going through stages in your life where, say, you&#39;re doing all intellectual stuff or all physical stuff or all out there in the world stuff without that internal, emotional-- What else can I say about Cancer? It&#39;s very much burrowing into yourself in this kind of way and making a home inside of yourself. If you&#39;re ever missing that in your life at some point, it&#39;s very hard to really get that sort of everything is okay. If you&#39;re missing--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I tended to bring my home with me, take my home with me. I learned how to do that, but it was hard.

 <br> It&#39;s sort of like like a mini grand trine. A grand trine is this wonderful aspect that everybody always wants.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Which I don&#39;t have.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Which you don&#39;t have. Linda has one. They&#39;re very, very rare. We have three planets that are all trying to be [unintelligible 00:04:15] circle of energy. It&#39;s like a mini grand trine with two [unintelligible 00:04:21] There&#39;s a really fluid connection between those three planets. It&#39;s nice, and puts more emphasis on the Pluto, which is in the middle.

 <br> Pluto in 8th house. The energy in both of those are similar. It&#39;s like the 8th house is the Pluto of the houses, kind of. It means that in some way there&#39;s a lot of emphasis in your life on transformation, a lot. There&#39;s a thing about Pluto where there&#39;s a constant need to transform yourself, move to another level. It&#39;s like the phoenix, is that symbol.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;m always talking about cycles and with this and with that.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The other thing about that transformation is you need to be doing that. People who have a lot of Scorpio in their chart need to go through these rather enormous transformations in their life pretty regularly or they go backwards.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: These are people that have Scorpio?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A lot of Scorpio, a lot of 8th house or a heavy Pluto. Any of those three. You need to go through transformations pretty regularly or the energy degenerates.

stage--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The trick is to move from that to the Sagittarian–[unintelligible] To develop to the 9th house thing which is the-- Geminis are collecting all the little pieces, and Sagittarius is the big picture, when you put it all together and you make it into a system or a vision.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s great. That&#39;s a good image.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The pitfalls of the two, Gemini can&#39;t see the forest for the trees and Sagittarians can&#39;t see the trees for the forest. It&#39;s fun-- Intellectual styles, it&#39;s 3rd house, 9th house, Gemini and Sag are real different. You can have huge arguments about it, too.

I go through this trauma every single time, even if it&#39;s just a poem. Usually I need to just go with the process and sit and not do anything about it for a couple of weeks, and then slowly of itself it&#39;ll-- When I try and force it it&#39;s very traumatic.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That&#39;s interesting, because I work the other way around. I get the big picture first, and then I have to go back and actually fill it in and make it so that it really is comprehensible and makes sense and back up what I&#39;m saying. That&#39;s were I get all--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: See, I start off by having the big picture, an idea, [unintelligible 00:11:39] the vision and then I gather all this little data, but to glue it together, that&#39;s where the trauma comes.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The other thing about this South Node, North Node things is that South Node is in Pisces and North Node is in Virgo. Some of the ways that intellectual stuff comes to you is in terms of-- It&#39;s Piscean, it&#39;s psychic and very fluid and spacey and a little mystical and all that, and the stuff that&#39;s harder and that you have to work for more is the much more disciplined-

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Detailed.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: -focused, detail-oriented.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sí. Exactly. Wow, do you know me.

 <br> [laughter]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Virgo in the 6th house are real interesting, especially being a Leo. I used to always have problems relating to that stuff, at all. The more I think about it, it&#39;s the hermit card in Tarot or the virgin, not in the sense of Virgin Mary, but the ancient virgins who were the temple priestesses.

Those are the things that make a focal in your chart, but what it means is-- Actually, I should look up more about Uranus and the 6th house, because it&#39;s such an unusual combination and the energy is very different in-- It&#39;s 6th house. Uranus being this very explosive, very-- I almost think of Uranus having this incredible sense of humor, almost. It&#39;s a very jester-like planet in you.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: In such a serious house.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The 6th house is such a serious house, and such a discipline, real, creating a sense of ritual about your life and very much evenly-- Everything is very ritualized and spaced. Uranus is all just explosion and very fast and very impulsive. It&#39;s an interesting combination. Anyways. What I think it means is that stuff about– First, there&#39;s also a thing of a tendency to get sudden illnesses.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yeah. Near death once. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: But fast. All of sudden. It&#39;s like you&#39;re fine one day, you&#39;re dying the next day, and that things.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sí.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Also to get over them fast, often, or to get strange illnesses. That kind of thing. It&#39;s also the house of the body [unintelligible 00:21:41]

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: The 6th house?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yeah. The body. It has lots to do with health and stuff, in general, the 6th house. It&#39;s [unintelligible 00:21:51] the body as temple. It&#39;s real 6th house kind of thing. It has lots to do with health and healing, and also with work and [unintelligible 00:22:06] [crosstalk]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Another thing about that, though, is in terms of Uranus being this planet of real sharp, fast insight, you should, especially in terms of physical stuff, you should really trust your impulsive, &quot;I need to stop eating this,&quot; &quot;I need to do this now.&quot; Whenever you get a sudden, &quot;I need to do&quot; whatever, in terms of your body, you should believe it.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: You should believe it.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I need tomatoes.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Probably your Jupiter in the 8th house, partly. It helps. You shouldn&#39;t be surprised if people give you money. You&#39;re likely to have people give you money sometimes when you really need it.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s happened, yes.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Very possible. In some strange way, it doesn&#39;t really make sense, 8th house has to do with other people&#39;s money. Taurus has to do with your own money. 2nd house Taurus, your own money. 8th house has to do with other people&#39;s money. You have your Jupiter there, which is the planet of expansion and good luck and fortune. It pulls you through. Money from other people will descend on you in these lucky streaks or from out there somewhere.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I hope it starts descending.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s nothing in your chart saying you&#39;re going to be wealthy, but it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re going to have a hard time of it, either.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I think what that means is that it just went direct. What happens is that when the planets switch from retrograde to direct or direct to retrograde, there&#39;s a period in which they slow down markedly, and then they go again. There&#39;s like a shifting of the gears and they slow down a lot. Different people make different things about it being more-- I don&#39;t even know what to do with it, but I know that there&#39;s something about--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It came up right when on the shift point or after the shift. That&#39;s funny, because I talk a lot about this shift in perspective in my essay.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s interesting. That&#39;s Uranus kind of stuff. Uranus is like-- it&#39;s like a kaleidoscope. You turn the kaleidoscope and the whole thing changes. That&#39;s Uranus kind of stuff. All of a sudden something happens, and the way the world looks to you is suddenly completely rearranged, all the pieces are in different places, and your perspective on something changes very fast and very radically. It&#39;s very Uranian.

 <br> It&#39;s going to be really interesting when it goes [unintelligible 00:28:54] I think it&#39;ll be a nice point, too. The Neptune stuff you can probably do without-- You can&#39;t do without it. It&#39;s there and you should deal with it. It&#39;s probably good for you, but it&#39;s not easy. The Uranus stuff, I think, will be fun. Traumatic in moments, but it&#39;s--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Isn&#39;t it happening now, though?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s there. I don&#39;t know exactly where.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: What does this--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. It&#39;s going backwards, so [unintelligible 00:43:37] Mars is in your 10th house. [unintelligible 00:43:46] Jupiter is your 9th house. [unintelligible 00:43:54] Jupiter is in your 10th house. Saturn is in the 10th house.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Are they going to stay there for the rest of the month, you think?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. I mean, well some of them will. Saturn-- As you move out along this way, they get slower. Mercury is the fastest. No, the moon is the fastest. Mercury and the sun are almost the same. I think Mercury&#39;s moving a little bit faster, and then Venus, Mars, Jupiter. Saturn will be in that house for a while. Even the Jupiter [unintelligible 00:44:44].

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;ll be a lot of energy.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Which one?

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: With all those in the 10th house.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yeah. A lot of 10th house coming up.

 <br> Yes, a lot of energy for your-- The stuff on you having a lot invested in wanting to make an effect on the world, there&#39;s a lot of energy for that. However you have chosen to do that, which I assume is you&#39;re writing, there&#39;s a lot of energy for that right now and a lot of stuff going on [unintelligible 00:45:13].

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;ve been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It&#39;s  been a lot of work. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Even just physically, of saying, &quot;Okay I&#39;ve done enough for today,&quot; and  stopping, so you&#39;re not wiped out for the next week, but it&#39;s also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It&#39;s not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it&#39;s not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There&#39;s something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They&#39;re different for the different aspects, and they&#39;re also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it&#39;s one of the  inner planets, it&#39;s one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It&#39;s too past Saturn and Mars as one. 

 <br> This side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it&#39;s with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it&#39;s inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don&#39;t know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.

 <br> How that goes into your sun, is first of all, that&#39;s really connected to your sense of  self. There&#39;s two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it&#39;s generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Well, I better start developing. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it&#39;s there. When you&#39;re looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it&#39;s different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It&#39;s the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It&#39;s in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;ve done drugs. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it&#39;s a drug thing. It&#39;s such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I think I do that too. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto&#39;s type spirituality is a very different- - It&#39;s much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It&#39;s more occult, it&#39;s more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It&#39;s  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff. Whereas Neptune is much more diffuse.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#99AFF2" data-initial-bg-color="#99AFF2" data-tags="Writing"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Writing</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:09:30</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>GA</strong>: Do you know if Scorpio is going to go into Scorpio in the next [crosstalk]? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, and it&#39;s a very heavy astrological thing. It takes Pluto, I can&#39;t  remember calculus. It spends approximately 20 years in this sign, and so it affects  whole generations, and it&#39;s very interesting stuff. You look historically at the different  Pluto transits, it&#39;s when Pluto was in Cancer, was the Depression. When Pluto was in  Leo was the discovery of atomic energy, and when it was in Virgo was drugs, all the  drug culture stuff. Lots of people getting into health stuff, all of a sudden. It sounds like an incredible transformation of consciousness in some way in relation to that  particular area. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s going to be-- 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Libra is like feminism and relationship stuff. Feminism. When it goes  into Scorpio, it&#39;s supposed to be the apocalypse, basically. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yes. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It gets very intense. 1984, actually, Orwell was into astrology, and he  picked that date. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see. I talk about this in my essay a little bit.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It goes into 1984. It should be very heavy. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It stays until the year 2000. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. The world&#39;s shortest transit, which is interesting because there&#39;s  one line about the apocalypse in the Bible. About, unless these times be short, all is  lost, or something like that. It&#39;s the shortest transit up until now. It&#39;s in Scorpio.  Anyway, yes, it&#39;s very heavy. Certainly, very interesting times we live through, even if  you don&#39;t know [unintelligible 00:11:17].</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#99AFF2" data-initial-bg-color="#99AFF2" data-tags="Writing"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Writing</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:11:17</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""> <br> <strong>GA</strong>: There&#39;s another sign that&#39;s going to be also in Scorpio. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, there&#39;s a thing going on. I can&#39;t remember exactly when it happens.  It&#39;s the lineup. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s in Scorpio or in Sag. It&#39;s a lineup of four of the outer  planets exactly in alignment at some point in the next few years, which is another  just-- Things like every time there&#39;s a lineup of any two of the major planets,  something really incredible happens. Every time that Jupiter and Pluto, I think, have  lined up, the president who has then been in office, has been killed in office. It&#39;s like,  oh, it&#39;s weird. When the outer planets line up, it&#39;s intense. Four of them, that never  happens. [unintelligible 00:12:05] 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s happening in &#39;82, I think, but I don&#39;t know which ones. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I remember somebody once was trying to explain this stuff to me. They  told me that things were supposed to get heavy in &#39;80, much heavier in &#39;82, and shit  hits the fan in &#39;84. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh. [chuckles] 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s like we&#39;re going to live through it. It&#39;s [unintelligible 00:12:27] very  rough timing. The other side of that is the Aquarian Age and also Pluto going into  Sagittarius, which will be a transformation in terms of philosophy, politics, and grand  belief systems. A new age. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m writing about.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Right. It&#39;s also like relationship stuff and figuring out relationship stuff is  an incredibly profound thing for you. It&#39;s like wherever Saturn falls is an area that is in  some way restricted, does not come easy. It&#39;s like the lessons that you have to learn.  There&#39;s a lot about what you have to learn, what you have to work out. Assuming  that you do when you get it together, you are richer and more wise in that area than  anyone else is, but it&#39;s a struggle anyway, so let me know. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Does the point of fortune have anything to do with the fact that it&#39;s in the  same house as Saturn?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not a conjunct. It would make a difference if it was conjunct. There&#39;s no conjunct.

Your Saturn is a retrograde. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A retrograde Saturn. One of the things that means is that, in some  ways, you don&#39;t have a real strong sense of boundaries. This is where I end. Real sense of, this is who I am in the world, and this is where I&#39;m going. It&#39;s self-limitation  in a way that gives you strength. In a way, it&#39;s both a plus and a minus. It&#39;s a plus in  that it makes it easier for you to reach out beyond that. It makes it harder in that it&#39;s  sometimes very hard for you to get a handle on where you end, where other people  begin, and where your responsibility to other people ends. Also, in terms of psychic  stuff, it means that you need to consciously develop psychic protection because the  world rushes in when you align. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It does.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: You don&#39;t have that automatic stopping point with it, and you can get a  little overwhelmed because you don&#39;t filter it out. Everything just comes in and hits  you so fast. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Mirtha&#39;s the same way. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. Which is good in terms of the way you seem to be setting up your  life now, when you spend a lot of time alone and you do your work. It&#39;s like the  perfect way to deal with that kind of way. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: [chuckles] It&#39;s taken me all my lifetime. It&#39;s taken me all these years. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s like perfect. You have to make your own space, find your own path,  and guard it in some ways. You got to cherish it to the point where you don&#39;t let the  whole world flood in on you, overwhelm you all the time. It&#39;s particularly psychic,  other people&#39;s psychic energies that are overloading their circles.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yes? I didn&#39;t know that. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Physical healing, &quot;laying on of hands&quot; kinds of stuff, so that in some ways, part of the expression or part of the way that you get in touch with that  particular kind of psychic stuff is very physical. Mars is a very physical energy, kind  of. That&#39;s what it&#39;s about. How you express yourself physically in your world. So  either, healing, laying on of hands stuff, or just that you get that psychic insights into  other people or the world or whatever will be felt by you on a very physical level, and  you will feel it in your body. As opposed to just singing or seeing images or whatever,  you will feel it. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Your body feels everything. It takes it on. Whenever I got into fights with people, I would want to throw up. That kind of thing. I did get into psychic healing where there is some touching.

The body just being very ill. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: When did that happen? 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I started having a period when I was three months old, so it&#39;s all my life.  When I was little we had to do farmwork and I always hated it because it was like being an animal [unintelligible 00:22:03] labor. I was willing to do head stuff and  not in an office where there&#39;s air condition, so that the body was like- I always felt like the body was a servant rather than a [inaudible 00:22:20].

Anyway, [unintelligible 00:23:24] 10 pounds, having all that stuff is that it&#39;s a lot of  ambition. Not in the sense of wanting to be rich and famous but in the sense of  wanting to make an effect on the world. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yes, I&#39;ve always felt very strongly. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Something else like not an important part of your life, that&#39;s real  important to you. It&#39;s much more important to you than it is to a lot of people. It&#39;s a  sense of, you will not be happy with yourself to just sit or lay back and let things  happen to you. Some sense of wanting to make a difference. We wanted to make a  real effect on some community of some sort. 

 <br> It&#39;s interesting because all the clients that fall in there and is the sun which is a sense  of yourself and what you want to be doing in the world. There is Neptune, there is  Venus, and there is Mars. Neptune is like aesthetics and love of beauty and harmony  and all that. Neptune is the psychic stuff and Mars is just like physical energy. It  seems my immediate take on that is the stuff that you-- It kind of affect you and your  make on the world is real positive.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yes. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not manipulative, wanting to be a hard shift kind of thing. It&#39;s much  more wanting-- You know, you feel what&#39;s inside of you and you want to put that out  there, it&#39;s more like wanting to give something to the world as opposed to wanting the  world to do something to you. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: You know that [unintelligible 00:25:17] comes up from you a lot is the  gentle penetration of the wind which is-- It&#39;s not like making a big splash, it&#39;s just a  steady gradual, continuous effect.

Okay, Mercury in 11th house is-- Mercury is  certainly the way that you-- Let&#39;s say you process informations [unintelligible  00:27:45], you think how almost everyone has their own particular grid that you take  the [unintelligible 00:27:53] instrument that you express yourself out there to.  That&#39;s like your Mercury. Just even on how you put information together. It&#39;s  interesting because if you need to do chart comparisons. People who have Mercury  square to each other have a really hard time communicating [unintelligible  00:28:14]. It&#39;s interesting. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Really?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, I want to have that with my lover actually. It&#39;s very funny, we&#39;ll try.  Just even talking intellectually about stuff. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: We misunderstand each other, we&#39;re going for hours arguing, and when  you get to the end. We realize that we completely misunderstood what the other  person has said. We&#39;ll be arguing politics and when we get to the end of the  conversation we realize we were saying the same thing from the beginning. That  kind of miscommunication happens a lot when a Mercury is [unintelligible  00:28:43]. People who have Mercury that are conjunct or tied to each other have a  really easy time.

Anyway, [unintelligible 00:28:59] 11th houses. A  lot of the stuff that you&#39;re intellectually interested in and that you want to think and  talk about and put together has to do with a very broad sense of humanity. Or of the  people of the world kind of stuff, and a real visionary sense in terms of that.  [unintelligible 00:29:27]. [laughter] 

 <br> A lot of that connectivity and groups, and group process and people being able to  work together. Yes, visionary stuff in terms of that. All sort of Aquarius, Uranus, have  little revolutionary things in your own and that sort of-- It&#39;s also the sort of intellectual.  There&#39;s a part of you that is very tied into occasionally flipping people out because  they need to hear things. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: [laughs] Shock again. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: What would people need to hear, at the moment because they don&#39;t  want to deal with, but they really need to [unintelligible 00:30:09].

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Right, and you&#39;re good at it. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I don&#39;t do it very often, but I do it and then people get scared of me, like  mean stuff. [chuckles] 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It sounds like the erroneous thing of exploding, a little explosion in  somebody&#39;s consciousness, and that&#39;s why you&#39;d go after doing that.

Is a love of language and  the beauty of ideas and that kind of stuff is all really important to you. The way that  you think and the way that you put ideas together has an aesthetic tinge to it  altogether. You&#39;re not into information for its own sake so much as the beauty of  different ways of thinking and of speaking.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;m into rhythm and pulse and image, and the form. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The opposition to the moon. I really have to look that one up because I  have some vague sense of it but not real clear, it&#39;s an important aspect of your chart. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Especially as a Libra and Mars are also opposite. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Usually, oppositions are opposite signs, the square and usually the  squares. Most of the aspects that fall around the signs.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Oh, not Neptune. I&#39;m sorry, Venus [inaudible 00:32:38]  <br> <strong>GA</strong>: A friend of mine did that. I don&#39;t know how accurate that is. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: This is how you draw the [unintelligible 00:32:48] squares on this  [unintelligible 00:32:50]. One thing that immediately strikes me in terms of this  particular opposition is there&#39;s a tension between all the stuff or the Mercury stuff I  was just talking about in your moon and areas, which is very impulsive, emotional  stuff. You feel something and you feel it now and you tend to say it right out there  and just act very fast. That is sometimes a little bit at war with your [crosstalk] the  lever, which is very into harmony and your sense of beauty and harmony and  balance and all that stuff. Is a little bit at war with the emotional nature, which jumps  right into everything. 

 <br> This is what I think right now, and this is what&#39;s true right now, and who cares if it  balances out anything and this is, whatever. There&#39;s little tension between those two.  Also, that sometimes your immediate emotional reactions to things can cloud your  intellectual clarity. You sometimes have to wait a little bit until the smoke clears  before you can really get clear on what you think about anything [inaudible  00:34:44] 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That happens. That&#39;s so true.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it&#39;s great. [unintelligible 00:35:04] It also tends to mean that that&#39;s  wanting to create and self-expression stuff is something that you started with real  early on and from childhood, there&#39;s that. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I started telling my sister stories so she would let me sleep, to shut  her up. I would tell her one story then she would want to-- Oh, the thing was that if I  didn&#39;t tell her a story, she would tell my mom that I was reading in bed with a  flashlight.

The moon interests me a lot. It&#39;s the strongest planet in my  chart, the sun and the moon. They&#39;re always strong in my chart. They&#39;re super strong  because it&#39;s sun in Leo which is always life and six planets of Leo and then there&#39;s  the moon in Pisces, single off in the planet. The moon really fascinates me in terms  of, I really think it has a whole lot to do with childhood and with patterns established  in childhood. A lot to do with survival mechanisms that get set up in childhood in  terms of how you learn to relate, how you learn to adapt yourself to the world  because it&#39;s very much about this half-conscious way of adapting to new stuff. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I wish I could get rid of some of the survival mechanisms. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yours are very fast. You have to react instantly and it has a lot-- Your  style of how you learn to get by in the world when you were young, it&#39;s sometimes  real and applicable when you&#39;re older, so it can be a problem. It&#39;s also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn&#39;t really get rolling until you&#39;re older. People  are much more like their moons when you&#39;re kids. 

You grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it&#39;s much more, you have no power and you&#39;re in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;m much better in crises. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s a great one for crises. I have a terrible moon for crisis. Well, it  depends. If it&#39;s the kind of thing where somebody else is in trouble, I&#39;m great  because it&#39;s empathy, but I&#39;ve been in a situation where people-- I had a guy back  me into the corner and be ready to rape me and I&#39;m sitting there empathizing, it&#39;s  like, &quot;You can be useless.&quot; If somebody else is in trouble and fine, I&#39;m in trouble. I  would [inaudible 00:38:02] but it&#39;s interesting. I always fascinated watching people  who I know really well, and so I&#39;ve seen them go through like real heavy, &quot;All right,  now we have to deal with something real fast.&quot; 

It&#39;s like you just see them absolutely clear. You would be real fast right on there.  Your only problem&#39;s you might react too fast to things without thinking. There 
wouldn&#39;t be any time lag and you wouldn&#39;t get thrown. You could like get right into it  and deal with [inaudible 00:38:36]. It&#39;s a real different chart [inaudible 00:38:52]

It&#39;s a wonderful chart. [inaudible 00:39:02] Anyway, the other thing about the moon childhood stuff, this part of the survival stuff  that you developed in childhood where your style of dealing with emotional stuff in  childhood was real fast. What do I want in this situation? And very much acting out  of, a very immediate and very fast sense of self and that&#39;s the way that you got by. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Where&#39;s the stuff? Sometimes I tend to hide things. I tend to hide my  emotions when I don&#39;t vocalize them right away, very fast. I do the opposite. I hide  them. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That probably has more to do with the [unintelligible 00:39:52] and the  aspects to probably [unintelligible 00:39:59] Although this is the expression, the  emotions, and the verbal expression, is like they don&#39;t go smooth together. That&#39;s  another thing about a difficult aspect, that can be a really positive thing in terms of  writing. In terms of there&#39;s a need to learn how to do that, and, therefore, you would  cultivate that more than someone else would. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Right. There&#39;s a value in having tensions in the writing, of there being  oppositions and there being a struggle between the elements. Otherwise, the thing  doesn&#39;t have any vitality. You&#39;ve got to do it in such a way that you can bring it off. [pause 00:40:44]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A lot of people go into a real heavy karmic thing with that in terms of you  choose your chart, which I&#39;m [unintelligible 00:44:05] about because the politics of  that can get decidedly weird. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I always wondered, I have two here. Well, actually, there&#39;s one here if  you don&#39;t count that. One, and two there, four there, one here, and one here, and  one here. You don&#39;t count the nodes, right? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: We don&#39;t count them as the nodes. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: So that the heavy ones are the eighth house, the tenth house? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The seventh, any place you&#39;re sounding false is going to be a little  heavy. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Would this be heavier than that, then? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it is. The most intense house in your chart is your tenth house  without a doubt. That&#39;s all right. That&#39;s also a good one. That&#39;s the only one that I&#39;m  not just drawing into.

Your moon in the air is-- Wait a second, my air is over here and once would be about here.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s because it&#39;s static. If we had things that we could turn around--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I know. People do charts like that sometimes where they have different pointers around. They do it for progressions that they have three different pieces of paper that are circles and there&#39;s one of your natal charts and then the transits and your progressions. They&#39;re moving them around and then they&#39;ll move it a little bit longer to see where you&#39;re going to be a year from now in relation to this and that and it&#39;s interesting. There are people who actually do that. Where am I at? Oh yes, you&#39;re around a square. Let me look at my notes on this for one second. One of the things that goes on with all the Eros connections, and in your case, I think it works mostly pretty well for you. It is all trines and it&#39;s like you can get a little lazy in this respect. Trines can make for a lot of laziness.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, that&#39;s one of my qualities.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I&#39;m not sure I have that luxury. [laughter] I&#39;m not all square. If you get lazy, you just stay in the same place. In your chart, it generally works fairly well. It&#39;s not like you mess yourself up with your Eros. You have absolutely no tolerance for boredom or for conservatism in the strict sense of the people who are interested in making it like they think it was three days ago. You&#39;re always moving forward, very inventive, with no respect for authority [chuckles] whatsoever, or convention, or--

 <br> If somebody tells you you should do things because this is the way they are done, this is absolute useless information to you, and you&#39;re very likely to do exactly the opposite exactly for that reason. It&#39;s the sense of--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Reacting?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Not in a bad way necessarily, but if you wanted to break through whatever structures are around you, you don&#39;t have any use for that, for social convention, in that sense. It really doesn&#39;t.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: In friendships too. I like to shake them up.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Oh, yes, it&#39;s a real shake-them-up energy. Aquarians are like this in general because they&#39;re ruled by that planet, but Aquarians always have this thing, they love to say things that are going to make everybody&#39;s jaw drop. They figure it&#39;s good for everybody to have their ideas shaken up periodically, and you have that also, of the sense of always wanting to figure out the thing that no one has thought of, that&#39;s going to--People getting their set images of the world, or set ways of thinking or whatever, you&#39;re the person who&#39;s always looking for the little something that&#39;s going to shift the way everything looks, that&#39;s going to turn the world upside down. Not for yourself, but for other people also. That&#39;s one of the services you perform for your friends; shaking up their worldview periodically, which is nice.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#DC8F8D" data-initial-bg-color="#DC8F8D" data-tags="Intellect,Identity"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Intellect</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Identity</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:11:19</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>GA</strong>: Sometimes they don&#39;t like this. [laughter]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Right, it could be a problem with Tauruses in particular, watch out for that. There&#39;s lots of ideas, lots of new ideas all the time and enthusiasm for everything, and there&#39;s this real quest for new stuff. Not just for newness in itself, which is a Gemini thing, just there&#39;s this sense of wanting to unhinge. It&#39;s an intellectual thing. Unhinge the way people are looking at the world, or the way that you&#39;re looking at the world.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s nice because you&#39;re really, in some sense, very comfortable with that energy. A lot of people have a lot of problems with that. You&#39;re fairly comfortable with it, and there is--There&#39;s some counterbalancing thing with your Saturn and Gemini. There&#39;s a particular intellectual rigidity that you&#39;ve had to fight in yourself, but on some levels, you&#39;re very much looking for the thing that turns it all upside down. The one problem with the amount of strength is that you can be impatient, and impulsive, and need to channel those flashes sometimes, or that will to break it all up and start all over.

Because occasionally, you can get into trouble with that if you don&#39;t stick around long enough to find out what&#39;s useful in some particular way of looking at something. You&#39;re immediately wanting to shake it all off and start all over, which can be a problem. I would worry about it more if it was square. I think it works pretty well for you for the most part, but there is occasionally a need for moderation. It&#39;s also, it being this very electrical explosive-- Not explosive, it&#39;s not quite the word, but--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Intense?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Very intense, but fast, intense. It&#39;s like flashes. Lightning or electricity is the best image I can think of.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I love lightning. Always [unintelligible 00:13:29].

Oh, you can short circuit periodically. That&#39;s all. It&#39;s another one of those stress yourself out of line, but it&#39;s really good that you&#39;re doing stuff like meditation or whatever, because there is this-- It can make you high strung after a while if you thrive on that explosive intellectual stuff to the point where you can burn. You can get yourself very frazzled if you&#39;re forever looking for the new thing to shake it all up, and you can just get real tired doing it.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I was an insomniac for a long time.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That&#39;s perfect. Yes, because Uranus transits, one of the major signs of Uranus transits is insomnia, when people are having real transits--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Wow.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I didn&#39;t even know this, when I had my chart done, I was having some strange Uranus transits at the time, and she said-- I had not said a word to her, but she said, &quot;Having trouble sleeping lately?&quot; She blew my mind. For the first time in five years, really having very heavy duty insomnia, and it was that. That and skin things. Like really strange little skin rashes is another Uranus transits thing.

It&#39;s like this very internal thing. I&#39;m not even aware of it, but it&#39;s very much rooted in me, this Uranian energy. It&#39;s also conjunct my Venus. I would do things like solve a math problem in my head in about 10 seconds that if I was to sit down and try and figure out the answer to, it would take me four hours. I even did that with astrology a lot, of like, &quot;I&#39;ll figure something out.&quot; I&#39;ll have just an insight, a flash of, &quot;Oh, this is X,&quot; and I&#39;ll say that, and then I&#39;ll get panicked about it, because I have no excuse for that answer. Then I&#39;ll go back and I&#39;ll track that, and I&#39;ll come out with the same answer four hours later, but that&#39;s very fast, non-linear
intellectual stuff. Yes, it&#39;s [unintelligible 00:18:53].

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have that with people. Like I&#39;ll see people, and I&#39;ll put two and two together, but in a way that is not like addition, you know?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s interesting because lots of times, you&#39;ll see like one or the other of the outer planets, which are the ones that have to do with psychic stuff. With you, you&#39;ve got both-- Your Pluto isn&#39;t all that strong in the chart, but you have both the Neptune and the Uranus are very strong, very focal, important planets so that your psychic stuff is coming in two different-- There&#39;s two different major sources of it.

One of them is that real oceanic, Neptuneian, empathic connection, which is very non-intellectual in any of the traditional senses of intellectual. It&#39;s totally feeling a spiritual non--It&#39;s very little to do with your mind than any traditional-- Or it&#39;s totally right brain kind of mind, if anything. It&#39;s connected with the mind at all. It&#39;s all the right side. Uranus is more of a traditional intellectual kind of thing, but it doesn&#39;t work linearly at all. It&#39;s not that kind of thing, it&#39;s a flash. Those are two very different kinds of spiritual energy.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have this problem that I always want to verify these flashes. It slows them down. I should trust them.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Although for you, there&#39;s some value to that. You should trust them, but there&#39;s also a thing of-- Well, I&#39;ll get to that when I get to your notes, of real education and grounding of some of your psychic stuff is really important. That&#39;s not a substitute for trusting the psychic stuff. It&#39;s like the two of them should go together, of that sort of training and education, and then just doing it. They work together very well. It&#39;s not like you should play them off each other. Either you know it or you have this insight into it. It&#39;s the two of them work together.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s a real sense. It&#39;s a place of a lot of learning because in some way, wherever Saturn is, this is something that doesn&#39;t come easy. Therefore you have a tremendous opportunity to learn about, but it&#39;s very hard. Saturn in the seventh is-- The thing of long term-- Well, traditionally it&#39;s marriage, but the sense of the perfect other or there&#39;s some real sense of really wanting the perfect other, or the person who is your compliment and is your lifelong companion or whatever. There&#39;s a real yearning for that and it doesn&#39;t come very easily at all.

 <br> I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a lot of things. First of all, there&#39;s really wanting that and also being afraid of it. Usually, wherever you have Saturn, you can go in one of a couple different directions with it. It&#39;s all like, there&#39;s a blockage and you can scatter in one of two ways. You can either get into a thing of you&#39;re completely obsessed with the relationships or you get into a thing of you&#39;re fiercely independent and you don&#39;t need a relationship.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I do both. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s a real thing of being incredibly aware of your own need for a relationship and vulnerability and feeling like you&#39;re incredibly needy or all this stuff. On the other hand, there&#39;s this real thing about total self-sufficiency.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have that, exactly.

Because I remember I mentioned before, your Saturn was retrograde. When Saturn is retrograde, a lot of the structure-- That thing about structure and protecting yourself from the world and defining yourself in relationship to the world in terms of your limitations of some rigid idea of who you are or whatever. When you&#39;ve sat on retrograde, to some extent, you don&#39;t do that in the usual way. You don&#39;t set your limits, you don&#39;t put barriers around yourself in the way that most people do.

 <br> It&#39;s another one of these things of you don&#39;t have a lot of psychic defenses. There&#39;s a sense of you take in stuff very easily. You don&#39;t have your little barricade against the world. If anything, the way it works, especially when you&#39;re younger, I think is you barricade yourself from your own self-conscious, but you don&#39;t barricade yourself from the world. It&#39;s like the defenses are internal. It&#39;s like it all gets turned inside of you, so that you are defending yourself against yourself as opposed to defending yourself against other people. I think it&#39;s probably particularly hard in childhood.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: This is because--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: You can have a childhood in which you could be incredibly rebellious, but nonetheless, you take it in, in some very profound way of like, you can be really-

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: This is a--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A little battered by the world.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Is this the way it&#39;s always going to be or only when Saturn is retrograde?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Wait the way it&#39;s always going to be for you or the way it always is with Saturn? This is your natal placement. To some extent, that&#39;s a constant for you. The thing to do with it is to learn--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s good though.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it is good in a lot of ways. Oh, there&#39;s one particular kind of barrier that you don&#39;t have to get through that a lot of people have. On the other hand, it&#39;s caused you a certain amount of pain if you&#39;re not defended against the world in that way.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That also means that you don&#39;t have to fight so hard to knock down the--You haven&#39;t gotten rigid in your definition of yourself in the world that most people have that then they have to bat down if they&#39;re ever going to go beyond that.

Just in terms of the very basic, general things about the chart, you&#39;re very on the air and fire. A little bit on earth, which is a good thing [laughs] in a chart like this. There&#39;s a lot of things about earth--Virgo in particular, and Virgo energy in particular, is very important, it&#39;s very crucial to you. There&#39;s this whole thing about discipline and ritual, very-

 <br> <strong>Gloria Anazaldúa</strong>: Sí.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: -sort of regular setting up rituals for yourself that help you channel your energy is a very critical thing in your life.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It is [crosstalking].

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s part of your path, basically. We&#39;ll get into that when I talk about your North node. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: OK.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Anyway, but basically, aside from that Virgo stuff going on, it&#39;s mostly air and fire, which is very self-expressive. Self-expression in the sense of there&#39;s a real need to put yourself out there in some way. You hate feelings of restriction. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh yeah.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The energy is very much going out, wants to go out all the time. Whereas the earth and water are much more self-contained, sort of gathering in energy.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Any kind of limitations on me, I can&#39;t stand it.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, well, there&#39;s a lot of stuff in here about how you could never do a nine-to-five job if your life depended on it. It&#39;s just not in the cards.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I know, I&#39;ve done it, but I can&#39;t--I just can&#39;t! [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: When I was looking up stuff in your chart, it was funny, there&#39;s about four different things in it say forget the nine-to-five jobs circuit. Everything in your chart says, &quot;No way.&quot; It&#39;s also a particular kind of playfulness to both those, more so than the other ones. Earth and water tend to be a little more somber and a little more-- Everything is gathered in. Can&#39;t remember the difference between centripetal and centrifugal, but the one that goes out is air and fire, and the one that sort of gathers in is earth and water, and you&#39;re heavy on air and fire. It&#39;s good that you have that earth in there, because otherwise you&#39;d be a little too unfocused.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#F2A7C3" data-initial-bg-color="#F2A7C3" data-tags="Identity"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Identity</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:02:25</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;d be [laughs] spaced out.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not so much spaced out, but just scattered. It&#39;s not like Pisces, that&#39;s real spaced out. It&#39;s sort of running in so many directions at once that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing anymore. A tendency to really exhaust yourself also, because you have so much energy and you have so much you want to do all the time that could get going off in too many directions.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I always want to do everything.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, well, there&#39;s a lot of stuff about that.

[unintelligible 00:03:06] I don&#39;t see you as much of a Virgo, either, although there&#39;s Virgo in your chart. Anyway. Also, you&#39;re very little fixed. It&#39;s mostly mutable, which is the Sag. Mutable or calm. There&#39;s two different ones. [unintelligible 00:03:29] that there&#39;s four different elements, then there&#39;s three different modes, they&#39;re called. There&#39;s cardinal, fixed and mutable. You&#39;re mostly cardinal and mutable. The only thing that&#39;s fixed in the entire chart is Pluto and Leo, and everybody born anywhere around us had Pluto and Leo. It&#39;s a generation thing, it&#39;s not very specific to you.

 <br> Which does mean that you have a tendency to have trouble sticking with things over the long haul, sometimes. On the other hand, it means that you don&#39;t tend to get real rigid around things. You have lots of initiative. The initiative is the cardinal, and that&#39;s the real-- The people who always start things off usually have a cardinal [unintelligible 00:04:20] within whatever element it falls in, its the beginning of that. It&#39;s sort of like the springtime of that particular element or the beginnings of figuring out what that stuff means. With you it&#39;s Ares, cardinal fire.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I&#39;ve got about six books that I&#39;m working on. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. They always have great ideas and tons of initiative and just go out there and they&#39;ll start anything, and they&#39;re very fearless, usually about going out there and doing it, but then they get bored.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s why I have [unintelligible 00:04:52] The novel, I started writing that in &#39;74, and I&#39;m still working on it. That&#39;s almost 10 years.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Libra has that also, sort of initiative. It&#39;s in a different sphere, it&#39;s much more in social stuff. You make connections with people very easily, and you&#39;ll do that. Then you have a fair amount of emphasis on mutable with the Virgo. You have the Venus in Virgo and your midheaven in Virgo and Sag rising. The mutable is distributive. It&#39;s wanting to make the connections between everything, whichever element it&#39;s in.

 <br> While Sag, in particular, is a lot that way of making the connections between philosophical ideas. It&#39;s a lot more communication and sort of putting the stuff out there in a way. The cardinal is the initiation and then the fixed is the consolidating whatever that particular element is. Then you get to the mutable, which is spreading it around in the world. You&#39;re big on starting it and spreading it around the world, and you have a little bit trouble of just sort of [unintelligible 00:06:19] [crosstalk]--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, let somebody else finish it.

That&#39;s the real basic, outlining system. All your planets are in one half, pretty much. This is more out-in-the-world focused, and this is much more of the introverted. Your moon is there, but a lot of, sort of your life is making connections with people. It&#39;s not about just purely probing your own psyche. It&#39;s a lot about putting it out there and honing structures in the world and making connections with people. Especially the 10th house thing, which will be good. There&#39;s more going in your 10th house than anywhere.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: The structures and stuff that I&#39;m putting out, are they mental?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, there&#39;s two things on that. There&#39;s all this 10 path stuff, and a lot of what you&#39;re putting out-- 10th house is-- In traditional astrology it&#39;s the house of the professional, meaning standing in community and that kind of stuff. In your case, it&#39;s more like a thing of making-- It&#39;s a lot about structures. It&#39;s the Capricorn house. It&#39;s the Saturn house, also. It&#39;s building structures in the world. It&#39;s a profession in the sense that you&#39;re building something. It&#39;s a real building house. There&#39;s some real need to do something in the world and to affect the world in some way. That&#39;s a real driving force, and your sun is there. Your sense of purpose, it&#39;s not enough for you to sort of be mountaintop figuring out, you know, whatever. There&#39;s something about needing to make some sort of-- To build something in the world. To build something that is useful to other people.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: [unintelligible 00:10:36] You&#39;re right about the harmony.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s a real thing about balance. It&#39;s interesting, because Libra--There&#39;s all these connections back and forth. Your sun is in Libra, and the Venus, which is this real strong, absolutely focal planet in terms of all this stuff, is the ruler of Libra. Libra is a very social sign in some ways, and they are very into balance and they don&#39;t really like to fight and they don&#39;t like conflict a whole lot, but they&#39;re not wishy-washy at all. They&#39;re very feisty. They have a real strong sense of justice a lot of the time. They&#39;d rather everything be in balance, but they can get just furious when somebody refuses to let that happen. Do you know what I mean? They can be really fierce fighters, and they would really rather not have to fight at all, but if it comes to that, you better watch out.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I never get angry, but when I do people just run. [laughs] They don&#39;t want to be around.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s true. That&#39;s perfect Libra.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, it&#39;s sort of like the 10th house is to houses the way Saturn is to planets and the way Capricorn is to science. There&#39;s one real nice astrology book in which they have-- they just give the numbers to all the planets and all the houses and all the signs and they link up of the first house is the Aries house is ruled by Mars. The second house is the Taurus house is ruled by Venus. It&#39;s that quality to that house but it&#39;s not-- So it has the flavor of Capricorn and Saturn in the sense of both of those, Saturn is the planet of structure and of building structures, and Capricorn is the sign that is the most involved with that stuff. That&#39;s what the 10th house is about.

 <br> It&#39;s not like your 10 house is ruled by Capricorn. Your 10th house in particular is ruled by Virgo, because that&#39;s what&#39;s [unintelligible 00:14:25] or it&#39;s ruled by Mercury. [unintelligible 00:14:30] Anyway, the stuff in terms of putting stuff out there is very much connected with all this 10th house stuff, which I&#39;ll go into some more in a minute. Also, there&#39;s the Mercury in the 11th, which is your intellectual vision, and it&#39;s in the 11th house, which is community. It&#39;s the Aquarian house. It&#39;s community and a utopian vision of the ideal community of the future. It has a lot to do with your friendships and collectivity and however you identify your community, that&#39;s 11th house stuff.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, there&#39;s a lot of real strong visionary stuff in your chart, especially having this-- Well, let&#39;s go back to the 10th house thing. The sun conjunct Mars and Neptune thing is a very powerful little grouping of planets. Your sun essentially it&#39;s your ego, not in the sense they talk of in yoga of you need to get rid of your ego. It&#39;s not that. The sun&#39;s your sense of self in some very deep way.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Is it the soul, the self?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not even &quot;the self,&quot; because your self is the whole chart. It&#39;s more like your conscious identity. It&#39;s more how you see yourself, how you see yourself very much in the world. It&#39;s a lot about will and sense of purpose and that kind of thing. Your moon is yourself also, but it&#39;s the less conscious, more emotional, reactive, emotional, less purposeful. The sun is like your sense of purpose. It&#39;s how you see yourself as an actor in the world. A lot to do with purpose and will [unintelligible 00:17:05] It&#39;s yourself. It&#39;s conscious identity. You need to be taking care of your sun stuff. If you&#39;re not taking care of your sun stuff you start feeling like you don&#39;t have any purpose in life.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: See, I get very--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: If you&#39;re not taking care of your moon stuff, you feel emotionally ungrounded, but it&#39;s a very different thing. It&#39;s stuff like you can feel very emotionally grounded and you&#39;re taking care of all your moon stuff or whatever, and feel totally listless in a way, because your sun is sometimes messed up at that [unintelligible 00:17:40] There&#39;s different aspects of yourself, but the conscious, identity purpose kind of thing is the sun.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#99E6FF" data-initial-bg-color="#99E6FF" data-tags="Community"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Community</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:19:04</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>GA</strong>: The woman who did the gnostic circle, she does that with the [unintelligible 00:19:08].

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes. You&#39;re going to like this book.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Oh, that&#39;s so [unintelligible 00:19:14] Anyway, okay. This conjunction here are those three planets. Sun conjunct Neptune in itself is-- actually [unintelligible 00:19:29]. All three outer planets are in some ways mystical, spiritual stuff to them, but in very different flavors. Neptune is the real oceanic, at-one-with-the-world, complete loss of ego, that kind of spirituality. I mean it&#39;s ocean. That&#39;s all I can think of is ocean, and this real sense of being very much at one with everything and peaceful and also very prone to-- It&#39;s also a planet of illusion and just being lost in stuff and drugs. People who have screwed up Neptunes are way into drugs. When there&#39;s problems with your Neptune, there&#39;s a real problem dealing with reality, altogether.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: A large part of my life is like that.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. It&#39;s a very hard aspect that way. You have a vision of how connected everything is and of how it should be that way and how everyone should be feeling that. The fact that the world as you have to live it day to day is so far from that is so horrible that there&#39;s a real tendency to just withdraw into yourself and build your own fantasy world, because there&#39;s this incredible--You have a sense of such empathy with all the stuff around you. There&#39;s all the violence or the whatever or the horrible stuff that&#39;s going on in the world. It&#39;s just too much to deal with alongside that feeling of connectedness with everything.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I can remember as a child feeling like that.

You&#39;ve got all this stuff in here about problems with growing a thick skin. I imagine you&#39;re a whole lot better at it now, but definitely when you were a kid of just the thing of having almost no psychic defenses and just the world just completely flooding in on you all the time.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Is that because of Neptune conjunct with sun?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That&#39;s a lot because of Neptune. It&#39;s also because of your Saturn is retrograde, which is different, but it also has to do with not being very well defended against the world, psychically. Especially with sun conjunct Neptune. There really is this thing of a real strong, empathic connection with everything living around you.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Like it hurt me when people were turning off the cigarettes on the grass. The grass is alive.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Right, that kind of stuff. It could be really agonizing on some level to be that in tune with what&#39;s going on. This is the problem with people with strong Neptune things is you&#39;re so aware of everyone&#39;s pain or everyone&#39;s whatever that you can&#39;t deal with it. It&#39;s like having skin of parchment or something. You&#39;re feeling everything&#39;s pain and everybody&#39;s pain and everybody&#39;s whatever. Even good stuff can be completely overwhelming because you&#39;ve got everybody&#39;s.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Then I tend to go the opposite way, to become callous, just in self-protection. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: You never really manage very well to be callous, I imagine. Probably callous by your standards is not callous by other people&#39;s standards. There&#39;s also, one of the things that people with that kind of stuff tend to do is withdraw into a real fantasy world. I have a moon in Pisces, a really strong moon in Pisces, which is similar stuff. It works in a different way than mine, because yours is much more connected with your sun, which means in some ways that you have a hard time getting a handle on who the hell you are.

 <br> Especially when you were a kid, I imagine, had a really hard time figuring out who you were and what you wanted to do in the world and what your sense of purpose was or what your own value was, even, because, first of all, it was really difficult for you to separate out yourself from everything else around. There wasn&#39;t a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way. If you feel like you&#39;re unequipped to deal with the world. Everyone else seems to wander around not getting upset about the grass, and [unintelligible 00:24:01]

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I couldn&#39;t believe these people. I hope you have a pen, because I don&#39;t have any cartridges.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, I do. Let me turn this off [unintelligible 00:24:21]

What that means is that when you  were born Cherrié, at the moment of your birth there happened to have been the  planet situated themselves in such a way that they actually formed these big shapes  in the middle of the sky. To have one is not super unusual but it&#39;s not that common  either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they&#39;re very important  because they tend to color everything else in the chart.  <br> 
You have both a T-square and a Yod, and the T-square is caused because you have  two planets that were 180 degrees away from each other, so they formed this  straight line, the red line. Then you had another planet that was 90 degrees from the  other two, so it forms two right angles or a T shape in the middle of the sky. The T square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit  together. However, X can be anything, Cherrié. That X could be a relationship, it  could be money, it could be material object, it could be work, it could be the perfect  body.  <br> 

It could be the perfect mind, it could be anything and X can change. You can decide  oh, oh, this is really X on Tuesday and then maybe by Thursday, you can say well I  thought about it again and I realized that&#39;s not really X, this is X instead. If you do  decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it,  for a while it really does make you feel complete. After a while it really gives you the  feeling of just like gee, this isn&#39;t quite right, it isn&#39;t quite working. You really feel oh I  have to go off and I have to find something else to fulfill me.  <br> 

It&#39;s really analogous to going around and looking for wall outlets. You find an outlet,  and you plug your plug into it and the energy starts flowing through and you feel  really great and then all of a sudden you short out. Of course, the most normal thing  to do in that point is to pull your plug out of the outlet and to say, &quot;Oh what a stupid  outlet, it isn&#39;t working, I got to go find another outlet.&quot; What the T-square is saying is  that you do have the short circuit inside of you. Now the short circuit is caused  because you have an imbalance of energy.  <br> 

Now you&#39;re not doomed to the short circuit. It&#39;s not saying to you, &quot;Oh, well, tough  luck, Cherrié, for the rest of your life you&#39;re going to be like this.&quot; It&#39;s saying no, okay  there is an imbalance and you can write the imbalance. Now what the imbalance is  depends upon the particular planets in the T-square. Now in your case, you have a  special kind of T-square, because it doesn&#39;t just involve planets. It also involves  these two points which are called the nodes. Now the nodes, are not really planets at  all.  <br> 

If you take the orbit of the earth around the sun, and then you take the orbit of the  earth&#39;s moon around the earth, those orbits cross in two places. The intersection that  faces north is the north node, and it points up, and it represents breaking away from  past life karma. The intersection that faces down is the self node, and it represents  getting sucked into past life karma.  <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Great.

That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, &quot;Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.&quot; What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it&#39;s just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.   <br> 

What this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn&#39;t just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It&#39;s saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, &quot;Yes, this is who I am. I&#39;m the power and what I want is right for everybody.&quot;   <br> 

Now where&#39;s Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it&#39;s in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.   <br> 

Having Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that&#39;s the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn&#39;t start off  saying, &quot;Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I&#39;m just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.&quot; It&#39;s saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.   <br> 

All right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you&#39;re breaking away is by seeing the truth that you&#39;re breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it&#39;s all illusions.   <br> 

It&#39;s not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It&#39;s telling you that you&#39;ve been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It&#39;s not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You&#39;ve already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don&#39;t have to see, &quot;Oh gee, what is power? I can&#39;t use it blah blah blah.&quot;   <br> 

In fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it&#39;s saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I&#39;m  not here.&quot; Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, &quot;Who me, Cherrié? Oh no, not me. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking  about. What power? I got no power.&quot;   <br> 

Yet at the same time, the people are there saying, &quot;Oh, Cherrié she doesn&#39;t have any  power.?&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;What do you mean I don&#39;t any? Hey, listen, I have all this power  and I got to use this power. Here I am.&quot; Then it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I do?&quot;  &quot;Oh, no. No, I was just kidding. Just kidding, folks. No, I don&#39;t have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.&quot; It goes back and forth. There are some days in  which you&#39;re right up there, you&#39;re right there looking straight into your destiny and  saying, &quot;Yes, this is who I am, and this is who I have to be.&quot; Other days you&#39;re just  looking at that and saying, &quot;Oh my God, I can&#39;t possibly accept this power. This is  just much too scary. It&#39;s much too much. No, I can&#39;t deal with it.&quot;   <br> 

It is this duality of saying, &quot;Yes, I want it. No, I don&#39;t. Yes, I&#39;ve got to have it. No, I  can&#39;t.&quot; What you&#39;re trying to do is to find the perfect balance, is to be able to be a  channel of that power, accept your power, but not feel that you have to take on too  much of the power and not feel that you can&#39;t accept yourself as you truly are. It&#39;s a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it&#39;s saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it. That&#39;s a really  important energy with the T.   <br> </p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#F2A7C3" data-initial-bg-color="#F2A7C3" data-tags="Identity"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Identity</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:11:27</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>CM</strong>: What were you saying about the illusion thing?   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: Now, the illusion works in two different ways. First of all, it&#39;s the illusion that  you can use power any old way you want. Every time you get a little bit too egoistic  or too cocky with that power, you do get smashed. Every time you say, &quot;Oh, right.  Hey, I want this.&quot; You talk yourself into thinking, &quot;Oh, this is for everyone else, and  it&#39;s really for Cherrié and it&#39;s long, and it&#39;s like the neon signs go off and the sirens,  and it&#39;s like, &quot;Don, don, don, wonk.&quot;   <br> 

It&#39;s like, &quot;Whoops, okay, I&#39;m not going to do it this time.&quot; The second side though, is  the more insidious side, because that part of the illusion is the illusion that your  negativity does to say to you, &quot;Oh, well, you can&#39;t have power. You&#39;re just too  messed up. You&#39;ll really misuse it. You can&#39;t touch it.&quot; The reason why it does that is  from your dark side&#39;s point of view, you&#39;re in this really terrible position because first  of all, it had power.   <br> 

It really had it, and you used it, and your dark side loved it because it had all this  incredible energy. It was like, &quot;Hey, I get to do whatever I want.&quot; Then you got  smashed. You really did get smashed. You went through a number of very painful  lifetimes, and your dark side lost its power. Now, here you are in this situation where  there&#39;s this power hanging right in front of you, and it&#39;s saying to you, &quot;Cherrié, use it.&quot;  You&#39;re there going, &quot;All right. I have to use it.&quot;   <br> 

Now, your dark side is fit to be tied because it looks at this and it says, &quot;What do you  mean she can use it? This is mine.&quot; It&#39;s being taught, &quot;Uh-uh. You don&#39;t touch it. You  don&#39;t get near it. You can&#39;t even breathe on it.&quot; Your dark side&#39;s freaking out saying,  &quot;Well, if I can&#39;t have it, she can&#39;t either.&quot; It&#39;s energy, instead of trying to co-opt the  power, it knows enough now that it can&#39;t possibly co-opt the power.  <br> 

You are in no way an evil person, and you&#39;re not going to be an evil person. It knows  it can&#39;t do that. What it figures it can do is to just keep you away from it. Because it  says, &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t want to get burnt. I don&#39;t want to get transformed. If I keep her  from being transformed, I&#39;m going to not be transformed either.&quot; It&#39;s always in there  creating all these illusions about the power, saying to you, &quot;Don&#39;t touch it. Don&#39;t touch  it. It&#39;ll hurt you. It&#39;s bad. You can&#39;t handle it. You&#39;re not ready.&quot;   <br> 

All these things so that you&#39;ll step back and say, &quot;Oh, Gee, oh, I&#39;m not ready.  Someday when I&#39;m ready, I&#39;ll touch it,&quot; or, &quot;Oh Gee, oh God, this is so much and I  can&#39;t handle this.&quot; Or, &quot;Oh wow, what if I blow it? Everybody looks at me and says,  gee, Cherrié, we were really depending on you, and you really blew it. Oh God, you  really let us down.&quot; It&#39;s got all these really insidious ways to get to you that are so  subtle that they&#39;re not out front. You can say, &quot;Well, gee, I must be doing this from  the right thing. I just want to be ready. I&#39;m doing this with a really good conscience.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m trying to mess things up.&quot;   <br> 

It also can get you through other people. It can say, &quot;Oh, Cherrié, you can&#39;t think  about yourself right now. You have to think about this other person or these other  people.&quot; Because then you can say, &quot;Oh, yes. Right. Well, see, I&#39;m not being selfish.  I&#39;m not being messed up. I have to go deal with this person, or this situation, or this  community, or whatever it is.&quot; It&#39;s telling you that you have to be really careful about  the illusions that your negative energy creates under the guise of positive energy.  The way you can tell is how it feels, because no matter what it sounds intellectually,  no matter how much you say to yourself, &quot;Oh Gee, really, it&#39;s got to be like this. It&#39;s  really got to be this way. It sounds really good in my mind. It&#39;s really creating it.&quot; If it  in your heart, you just don&#39;t feel good about it, you&#39;re just saying, &quot;I&#39;ve got do this. I&#39;ve  got to.&quot; Then you know, you&#39;ve got to go with what your heart says.   <br> 

What your negative energy does is it creates all this mental veneer, it keeps pulling  things up in your mind and saying, &quot;Cherrié, what about this? Oh, and how can you  think you&#39;re ready? Isn&#39;t that ego?&quot; Then you think, &quot;Oh, [unintelligible 00:15:44], it  must be ego. I can&#39;t think I&#39;m ready, so I&#39;m not ready.&quot; Whereas it&#39;s all that energy  saying, pull her back. Pull her back. Don&#39;t let her go. Don&#39;t let her go.&quot; That&#39;s why  really accepting your destiny is really confronting that intellectualization of that power  as well.  <br>

There is  no planet on the chart because if there was a planet, then you wouldn&#39;t have a T at  all, you&#39;d have a cross, which is a completely different energy. That missing planet is  called the void. It is directly opposite the stem. Your stem is in Taurus. Your void  then would be in Scorpio in the first house.   <br> 

Now, the first house is the house of self-identity, and Scorpio is power. What this  says is that the thing that you really need to do is to identify with the truth of your  power. The truth that you are a divine warrior in this lifetime. I mean, you really have  to be. There&#39;s lots of things that you have to get out there and confront that Cherrie  and her Libra essence would rather not deal with it all.   <br> 

Your Libras, there&#39;re going, &quot;What? Me? Oh no, not me. I&#39;m just sitting here spacing  out.&quot; Whereas that Scorpio energy is right in there. It&#39;s going, &quot;You are a divine  warrior. You got to get out there. You have to clothe yourself in the truth. You have to hold the sword of truth and you have to communicate it. You have to be it.&quot; There&#39;s a  lot of parts of you that are in there saying, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to look at this destiny  because it hurts. Besides it&#39;s scary. Can&#39;t I just stay here and live in a little house on  the ocean and not look at anything.&quot;   <br> 

You&#39;re being told, &quot;Uh-uh, Uh-uh, you got to get out there and confront.&quot; That&#39;s the  thing that&#39;s really scary, is that sense of, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve really got to get out there and  confront. I&#39;ve really got to get out there and deal with the energy.&quot; The other side of it  is it says that you&#39;ve got to really use that power that for many lifetimes you&#39;ve been  sitting on it and really saying, &quot;I&#39;m not ready, I&#39;m not ready. I can&#39;t use it. I&#39;ll just blow  it again. I&#39;ll blow it again.&quot; This lifetime, you&#39;re right there. It&#39;s like your divine energy  has come right down to you and it&#39;s saying to you, &quot;Okay, Cherrie, this is the time.  This is it. You really have to use the energy. You cannot possibly ignore this.&quot;   <br> 

You&#39;re finding yourself having to really deal with that energy, having to accept it in  spite of yourself. Now, the fact that the Scorpio is in the void does not mean that you  don&#39;t connect to Scorpios. As a matter of fact, what it says is that at times Scorpios  can be incredible catalysts to your life. Because it&#39;s almost like their energy,  especially if their sun or any planet that they have fits into the void. It&#39;s saying that  then that energy really helps you to realize the T-square energy. Of course, Barbara  is a Scorpio. I don&#39;t know if her son, I can&#39;t remember what the degree of her son is,  so I don&#39;t know if it fits into this or not. Do you know what day she was born on-- November?   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: I&#39;m just forgetting. Oh, no. 17th.   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: 17th. There is a real good chance that her Sun would fit into this void. That  would just be an interesting thing because it would say that in her very essence  would help you to work out this T-square energy. That&#39;s just an interesting [crosstalk]   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Yes, makes sense.

Now you also have a Yod. Now a Yod is a partially  resolved T-Square. It&#39;s as if you&#39;ve gotten a T-square and almost worked it out to  completion, but just didn&#39;t quite manage to get it totally synthesized, like in another  life. A Yod is called a Yod because actually Yod is the Hebrew letter for Y, and it is a  Y shape. You&#39;ve got two sets of planets that are 60 degrees away from each other.  They form a 60-degree angle, then both of them are 150 degrees away from the  stem point.   <br> 

It&#39;s interesting that the stem point here is also Jupiter. Jupiter is the stem for both the  T Square and the Yod. What this says is that you have to be really careful at pushing  yourself too hard. It&#39;s like you&#39;ve wanted to get through this karma so badly that  you&#39;ve almost decided in past lives that you were just going to burn straight through  it. You had at least in one lifetime, I know of at least one in which you were just, ugh. You just decided, lay it on me Lord. It was just like, &quot;Okay, I am just going to totally  burn through this. I am not going to get stuck in this again.&quot; You did have, I don&#39;t  know if it was your last lifetime or the lifetime for it but it was incredibly painful. It was  very much involved in this intense victimization experience. Your death was a particularly incredibly horrible death where you died. You were raped and murdered  in your death and it was just this incredible thing [crosstalk] to sustain. Pardon?   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: I was saying, why does it feel so recent? 

<strong>Amy</strong>: Recent? [inaudible 00:21:16] I&#39;m with you. 

<strong>CM</strong>: When you said that, it felt so recent. 

<strong>Amy</strong>: Oh, yes. It was so traumatic for your soul. Yet, see, the thing that was so  intense about it is that in this really weird way, you engineered it because it was  almost like you said, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s it. Okay, maybe I victimized some people. Well,  I&#39;m just going to burn right through it. I&#39;m just going to rip it off my soul because I&#39;m  not going to deal with this anymore.&quot; See, I feel like your misuse of power was  probably a number of lifetimes ago and you started off dealing with it more  intellectually, and you got very frustrated where you felt like, I have to get back to  using this power. I can&#39;t stand being impotent and not being able to use the power. 

What you decided to do was to just sear it right off of you and you had this life. It was  weird because it&#39;s almost like you didn&#39;t have to go through it. It&#39;s like you just got  this thing in your head that you had to release the energy and it&#39;s like you couldn&#39;t  realize that the way you had to release it was to forgive yourself. It was you couldn&#39;t  forgive yourself. You were so tied into this idea that somehow you were really evil,  that you couldn&#39;t just say, &quot;Hey, look, just forgive yourself. Let it go.&quot; 

It was almost like in that lifetime, things just kept happening to you that were  incredible. It was almost like one of those catastrophic lifetimes where you just could  think, what next? How could something else happen to this woman? Yet you would  just keep walking right into it. It was like, this isn&#39;t hard enough. This isn&#39;t heavy  enough. I&#39;m not going to be convinced that I&#39;m released until I hit something really  heavy. 

Finally, when you went into that death, it was about the heaviest thing that could  possibly happen to you. It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing? You don&#39;t have to go through this.  Are you crazy? What it set up there Cherrie, is this real, almost like this intense self hatred because you felt like, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I did this. Talk about stupid.&quot; Then in this  lifetime, you have to forgive yourself doubly because not only do you have to forgive  yourself for the misuse of power but you have to forgive yourself for your ultimate  victimization. That in a way is the hardest because you really have forgiven yourself  for the power.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#FF9A6F" data-initial-bg-color="#FF9A6F" data-tags="Past Lives,Identity"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Past Lives</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Identity</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:23:57</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>Amy</strong>: You know except when you&#39;re really feeling depressed that you&#39;re not an evil person.  You really know that. Sometimes you get to a point, and you get scared and you get  depressed and you feel like, &quot;Oh God, I really must be fucked up for this to be  happening to me.&quot; Basically, it&#39;s pretty much all taken care of but the one about the  victimization is not taken care of. Now, in one way, it&#39;s a good thing because It really  fuels your anger because you see that you bought it in that lifetime. You really  bought that woman bullshit of like, &quot;Oh, well, you&#39;re a woman and so tough luck.&quot; This is the way the world is and women were made to be stepped on and you really  bought it in that lifetime, and you really took it and you really embodied it.   <br> 

On one hand, there&#39;s a part of you that knows that and sees that, and it fuels your  anger. That&#39;s a good thing because you know it&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m not going to take this  again and I&#39;m not going to let other women take it which is a really good energy.&quot;  What happens is you take it really personally then and you say, &quot;Well, sure you are  really messed up.&quot; If you ever get taken advantage of, it&#39;s like reliving the rape and  the murder. It&#39;s like reliving that energy. Sometimes you&#39;re really confused at why  you take hurt so hard. Even if someone is just minimally hurtful to you, maybe they  don&#39;t even mean it. There&#39;s a part of you that just takes it so into your heart and it&#39;s  so overwhelming to you, and you get really angry with yourself.   <br> 

You feel like, &quot;Will you just stop it? You are not going to be like this now. Just be  strong. Be together. Why are you feeling like this? That person can&#39;t hurt you. Don&#39;t  let them hurt you.&quot; Yet, at the same time, there&#39;s this incredible pain that just washes  over you and this incredible feeling of hopelessness and of destitution and feeling  really alone and there is no way that anyone can help you or love you. It&#39;s almost like  just feeling that you&#39;re falling into this incredibly deep, dark pit. What that is, is that&#39;s  that woman in you that went through that, that still is experiencing it. It&#39;s like every  time anyone hurts you, she relives it. It&#39;s like all she wants to do is die. She really  wants to die. She just wants to let go.   <br> 

She doesn&#39;t want to have to be stuck there being tortured anymore. The thing that  you have to do is you have to release her because you don&#39;t need her anger  anymore. You needed her anger when you were a little girl because you needed it so  that you wouldn&#39;t buy into it and so that you wouldn&#39;t get caught up in the bullshit.  You needed it so that you wouldn&#39;t get stuck in all that Libra openness to other  people. She kept you. Every time you started losing it and started being too open to  other people or losing your integrity or losing your ideal, she was right there being  angry, saying, &quot;How can you do that? How can you let me down? They hurt you.  Don&#39;t let them hurt you again.&quot; She was really necessary but at this point, Cherrie,  you don&#39;t need her anger.   <br> 

If you buy into it, if you let her continue to make you feel the hurt and to make you  feel the torture, you&#39;re keeping yourself from being the power that you have to be  because not only does she have anger, she has fear. She&#39;s the part of you. It&#39;s  almost like she&#39;s this little personality inside of you and she&#39;s the part of you that  every time you start feeling really powerful shuts down because what happens is she  gets scared. It&#39;s that thing of, &quot;Oh my God, they&#39;re going to do it to you again.&quot; She  just shuts down. She makes you feel this incredible panic, this incredible fear. She  can&#39;t keep you from doing your destiny but she can make it a lot harder.  <br> </p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#FF9A6F" data-initial-bg-color="#FF9A6F" data-tags="Past Lives,Sexuality,Relationships"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Past Lives</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Sexuality</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Relationships</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:28:07</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>Amy</strong>: It&#39;s like, first of all, you&#39;ve got to confront her and you&#39;ve got to say, &quot;Look, okay, I  know, I accept it. I know what happened to you and I&#39;m not going to forget. I promise  I will not forget and I promise I will not let it happen to you again. I also know that  you&#39;re tired, that you can&#39;t continue like this and you need to let go.&quot; It&#39;s like you&#39;ve  got to let her stop hurting because she hurts all the time. She&#39;s that part of you that  sometimes when you&#39;re alone or sometimes when things are the best when you&#39;re  really feeling good, you feel a lot of love, you feel a lot of respect, you feel a lot of satisfaction. She&#39;s that part of you that can&#39;t let go, that just can&#39;t accept it. It&#39;s like  she wants to accept it so badly. It&#39;s like she&#39;s right.   <br> 

There&#39;s the river and she really wants to step over it and she&#39;s in there going, &quot;I can&#39;t  Cherrie, I&#39;m too afraid. I&#39;m too afraid that if I accept it, if I feel the love, if I feel the  positive energy, then it&#39;s just going to destroy me. Then they&#39;ll get me.&quot; Then they&#39;ll  say, &quot;Ah, we got you. We knew it. We knew that if you just relaxed and you felt good,  then we could really make you hurt.&quot;   <br> 

She just can&#39;t. That&#39;s why you think sometimes you&#39;re so crazy because sometimes  when things are the best, you feel the most panic-stricken because she&#39;s in there  saying, &quot;Oh God, I can&#39;t deal. It hurts too much.&quot; It&#39;s like if you&#39;ve ever been out in  the real, real, real cold and it&#39;s so cold and you come inside, and you&#39;ve just gotten  numb, and then you start feeling things. It just trickles and hurts and you get the pins  and needles. It&#39;s that energy where she&#39;s just gotten so numb that when she starts to  feel love, she freaks out. She just freaks out because it just hurts so much.   <br> 

It&#39;s the same thing with sexuality. It&#39;s like sometimes when you feel the most  openness in sexuality, you feel the most desire to shut down because it&#39;s the same  thing because in her head, you know, sexuality is bad. It&#39;s what got her in trouble. It  says, &quot;All right, you feel good about this. Well, listen, sweetheart, I&#39;m going to make  you shut down.&quot; Sometimes after the most wonderful sexual experience, instead of  feeling good, you just feel awful because it&#39;s like opening up to that energy.   <br> 

It&#39;s really realizing that it is okay and you can forgive yourself and you can accept  yourself and things are going to be all right in this lifetime. That&#39;s like a really really  scary energy. It just feels so scary to you that you just feel like, &quot;Oh, how can I  accept this? I can&#39;t accept this. If I accept this, then what kinds of other things are  going to happen?&quot; That&#39;s why it is just so important for you to be able to let her go  and to be able to say to her, &quot;Okay, you don&#39;t have to guard me anymore. You don&#39;t  have to make me accept you anymore. You don&#39;t have to make it happen because I  know what I have to do and I&#39;ll protect you.&quot;</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#F2A7C3" data-initial-bg-color="#F2A7C3" data-tags="Identity,Past Lives"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Identity</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Past Lives</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:33:52</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>Amy</strong>: You are always experiencing a very, very deep guidance energy. It&#39;s saying that you  really have to pay attention to this guidance. Now, the problem is that the guidance  comes intuitively and that it&#39;s really, really easy for you to block that intuition. It&#39;s  really, really easy for you to not connect to that truth inside of yourself at times,  because your sun is conjunct to your mercury, which means that Mercury&#39;s mental  energy sun is being-ness. You just accept your mind energy. Your mind really comes  in there and it really says, &quot;What are you talking about, Cherrie? What&#39;s this? What  do you mean, what are you talking about? How can you believe this?&quot; It&#39;s saying that  you pick up on energy all the time.   <br> 

I walk into this room and you&#39;ve never seen me before, and sure, your mind&#39;s going  to look at me and say, &quot;Oh, so that&#39;s Amy, and she looks like this, and she does this  and blah, and blah,&quot; but your intuition is going to look at me and say, &quot;Oh, so that&#39;s  Amy. Well, she&#39;s this, she&#39;s that. She said something.&quot; Nine out of ten times, you&#39;re  absolutely right with your intuition. The problem is that your mind comes in and it  says to you, &quot;What the hell are you talking about, Cherrie? You don&#39;t even know this  person. How do you know that this is going on?&quot; Especially because you don&#39;t just  do it about people, you do it about rooms and dogs and cats and books and  situations.   <br> 

You could walk into a room and maybe it&#39;s a beautiful room and there&#39;s all kinds of  nice people there. You say, &quot;There&#39;s a lot of tension here.&quot; Maybe someone with you  is saying &quot;Cherrie are you crazy? Are you out of your mind, everything&#39;s fine. What&#39;s  wrong with know?&quot; And maybe say, your mind goes, oh, yes. Boy, are you stupid?  [inaudible 00:35:39]. Then, you know, maybe three weeks later when a friend  comes to you and says, &quot;Well, Cherrie, you remember we went to that party and there  was this stuff. I didn&#39;t realize it, but there was all this stuff going on between so and  so and so and so. They just had this big fight, and they&#39;re not living together  anymore, and blah and blah.&quot;  <br>  

You&#39;re saying to yourself, &quot;That was the tension that I felt.&quot; Now, the problem is that  your mind has absolutely no conscience. That lots of times what happens is it says  to you, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re full of shit? What&#39;s wrong with you? You can&#39;t trust such and  such.&quot; Then when weeks later, you find out that such and such is true, your mind has  no qualms about coming back and saying to you, &quot;Cherrie, you knew that that was  true. Why didn&#39;t you do something about it? Oh, boy, you&#39;re stupid. I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;  It&#39;s the kind of thing where, see, your mind will switch sides. It doesn&#39;t care. It just  wants to be right.   <br> 

That&#39;s why it&#39;s really important for you to give enough credence to your own intuition  because you get guided so much. I cannot stress how much you are guided. You get such strong guidance energy, and yet at the same time, it&#39;s really easy for you to  negate that guidance. Lots of times it&#39;s like running around the rose bush. You go  around and around and around, and finally, you&#39;re so exhausted, you just give up,  and you just give into the intuition. Then you realize that you just should have given  into it a long time ago. You say, &quot;Oh, wow, this was right. What&#39;s wrong with me?  This was absolutely right. Why wasn&#39;t I trusting this energy?&quot;   <br> 

It is just really really important for you to make sure that you do trust this energy, and  you do know that it is absolutely right for you, and you do know that this is the right  energy, and you can give yourself a lot of support for what you&#39;re actually feeling and  realizing that that&#39;s exactly right for you. It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ve got to be feeling at  this time. The other thing that goes along with that is just the realization that you  really need to follow your hunches. You just get hunches about everything, and  they&#39;re really gut-level. Lots of times you don&#39;t follow them because you are scared,  because you think, who am I to have these kinds of hunches? Obviously, they can&#39;t  be true. They&#39;re not true.   <br> 

Then in reality, you wish that you had followed them. Now, the moon energy is the  intuitive energy. It&#39;s also one of the female energies because it&#39;s the real mother  nurturance. It&#39;s like the goddess energy, and Mars Is the so-called male energy.  Because your moon is conjunct to Mars, it&#39;s saying that you really have to synthesize  your male energy inside of yourself. Because what happened after you went through  that rape and murder, I mean, obviously you just [unintelligible 00:38:31] to your  male energy. You just said, &quot;All right, that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t connect to it.&quot; The problem is,  that it&#39;s your male energy that holds your power.   <br> 

You&#39;ve been trying to get it into your female energy, but your male energy isn&#39;t about  to let it go, not now, anyway. What you need to do is you need to synthesize your  male energy into your female energy. As long as you hate your male energy, you&#39;re  not going to be able to serve your power. It&#39;s really really important for you to accept  that male energy into yourself. Now, you don&#39;t have to term it male energy. It&#39;s just  the so-called male energy. It&#39;s just that power. It&#39;s that aggression, it&#39;s that ability to  really focus, to really deal outside of yourself. You have identified it as your male  energy in past lives. As far as you&#39;re concerned, you still identify it as your male  energy.   <br> 

That it&#39;s really important for you to really bring that back into yourself and get it to  really hook up with your female energy and get it to really hook up as a positive  energy. As long as you see that power as negative, as long as you see that power as  an ability to hurt, you&#39;re not going to be able to be 100% effective. It&#39;s really  important for you to draw it back into yourself and to really tie it up to your goddess  energy and really accept it in the depths of your soul.

You have what&#39;s known as a  soulmate or a karmic mate. This is a person that you have been involved with in past  lives in many different ways. You may have been her lover, you may have been even  enemies, or parent and child, or teacher and student, or siblings, or colleagues, or all  kinds of things, and in this lifetime, you come together with the potential to be one  with each other on all levels, mentally, physically, psychically, sexually, emotionally,  spiritually, every single level you can think of, you have the ability to be one with this  person.   <br> 

However, there is no way to tell if someone is your soulmate by what sign she is, by  what the person looks like, by what they do, by when you meet this person. There is  no way to tell by any external means. The only way to tell when a person is your  soulmate is by the fulfillment of different indications. There are also ways to tell  because this relationship is not a lot of things. It is definitely not in any way, shape,  or form an abusive relationship. It cannot possibly be an abusive relationship. It is  also not in any way, shape, or form a relationship that does not allow you to be your  true self. This person has got to totally support you in your true destiny, just as you  must support her in her true destiny.  <br>  

Now one of the indications is the fact that you find you cannot separate from this  person, literally, physically. No matter how much you try to be apart, there is some  greater force than yourself bringing you together so that you find that you can meet  this person and maybe at first you don&#39;t feel a big thing. Maybe you meet this person  at a party or a bar or a conference or a meeting or something like that and you might  feel like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Somehow you&#39;re going to keep connecting to this person. It&#39;s like,  &quot;Look, Cherie, this is the person. This is it,&quot; which is why you can never meet the  person and then do nothing and then someday wake up when you&#39;re 85 and in the middle of the night and say   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: She is the one. [crosstalk]-   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: -&quot;Oh my God, it was that birth and then I blew it.&quot; It&#39;s not like that. You get  chance after chance after chance, which is why even if you&#39;re together and you feel  like, &quot;Oh, fuck, I don&#39;t want to deal with this.&quot; Forget it. You find that you&#39;ve got to be  there. You&#39;ve got to work it out together. The second qualification is the fact that you are willing to put more into this relationship than any other relationship you have ever  experienced. This relationship forces you to go beyond your own ego and your own  sense of self and it&#39;s mutual. You are both working out this relationship energy, so  it&#39;s not like you can&#39;t do it. It&#39;s like you are forced to deal with it. You are forced to do it. You find that in spite of yourself, your head might be going, &quot;No way, Cherie, why  should you work it out? Forget it. You are not going to work it out,&quot; and your heart is  saying, &quot;You get in there and you work it out. You are not about to not work it out.&quot;  You find that you cannot help but work out the relationship. You find that you cannot  help but deal with this relationship in a complete way.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: It&#39;s terrifying. [laughs]   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: I know it is.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Just saying.   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: It is. The third qualification is the fact that the relationship itself follows a  certain pattern. First, there&#39;ll be a plateau and everything will be very nice and very  easy and very lovely. Little by little, it builds up to some kind of crisis point. Now it  might be your crisis, it might be the other person&#39;s crisis, it might be internal, it might  be external, but it&#39;s some kind of crisis point. You find that the more you&#39;re able to  work out the crisis point, the more able you are to love each other, to be together, to  experience oneness with each other. Then it goes to another plateau until it builds up  to another crisis point. The amount of time between the crisis points depends upon  the couple.   <br> 

For some couples, it&#39;s every two minutes, and for other couples, it&#39;s every five years.  It just depends on what it is that you&#39;re working out. The fourth qualification is the fact  that you find it&#39;s really difficult to explain why you love this person. You can&#39;t explain  it. It goes beyond explanation. Cause you feel like, &quot;I love her because she&#39;s so-- No, that&#39;s  not it. It must be because she&#39;s-- No, that&#39;s not it. I think it&#39;s because of-- No, that&#39;s  not it.&quot; You find that you just cannot possibly explain it. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s so deep. It feels  so intense inside of yourself. You cannot explain it in any way, shape, or form. It&#39;s a  really deep energy. All you can do is really trust that energy and know that this is  exactly the right energy for you.  <br> </p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#F7ED78" data-initial-bg-color="#F7ED78" data-tags="Relationships,Sexuality"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Relationships</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Sexuality</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:46:59</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>Amy</strong>: What the soulmate indication does is it guarantees that you will meet this person.  What you do after that its up to you. It doesn&#39;t say, &quot;Oh, and you&#39;ll live happily ever  after.&quot; You still have to work out the relationship. Obviously, for you, it&#39;s a very  intense energy because you do have a real struggle opening up your heart.  Obviously, this person is definitely going to open up your heart, and she is not going  to allow you to close down. The other thing is that it&#39;s really forcing you to let go of  pain around relationship. It&#39;s forcing you to work out sexuality, and it&#39;s forcing you to  open up to the truth inside of yourself. It&#39;s forcing you to say, &quot;Yes, this is who I really  have to be. I can not be anybody else.&quot;   <br> 

Now the other thing it says is that with the Saturn conjuncture Neptune that in this  lifetime, you really have to use your healing energy in your work. Of course, you can  only do that when you experience love in your heart, and that you really have to experience a deep openness and a deep energy inside of yourself, and that you just  have to know that this is the truth, that you have really got to experience the truth  inside of yourself. You&#39;ve really got to experience the knowledge that you are a  healer in this lifetime and that you&#39;re really meant to use the love that you&#39;re feeling  from other people to learn to love yourself, to learn to forgive yourself.   <br> 

The key here is self-forgiveness, it is self-acceptance, and it&#39;s the knowledge that all  you can do is really, really be open to this truth. All you can do is really, really be  open to what you know is true inside of yourself. Now Saturn, Neptune, and Venus  are sextile the moon and Mars. This is interesting because then Venus is sextile the  Mars, which is the union of the so-called male-female energy. It does say that when  they work together, you feel a real sense of completeness and openness inside of  yourself.   <br> 

Then these are both in conjunct to Jupiter, which says that at times you feel a real  duality between that really active part of you, the real so-called male aggressive,  active, powerful part of you, and then the real victimization part of you so that what  you&#39;re trying to do is to switch energy. You&#39;re trying to get the male energy part of  you to experience nurturing, to experience love, to experience hope, to experience  transformation. You&#39;re trying to get the female part of you to stop being the victim  because that female part of you still really identifies with the victim. You need to get  her to feel strong, to feel strength to power, aggression, all the things that you want  to feel. You&#39;re switching the energy.   <br> 

That&#39;s what the Yod is talking about is the real switch of energy will allow you to  release yourself from that duality because it says at times, you really experience that  duality, and it is very confusing to you. Here you are, one day, you can be so strong  and so aggressive and totally like, &quot;No, I do not experience this pain inside of  myself.&quot; Then the next day, you can just totally fold in on yourself and experience  real victimization.   <br> 

It&#39;s very confusing to you because you feel like, &quot;What is going on?&quot; Of course, then  too, you&#39;re giving real mixed messages to people. Both I&#39;m invincible, I am strong,  and I&#39;m the complete victim. Then you&#39;re feeling like, &quot;What the hell? What kind of  credibility do I have that I&#39;m expressing both of these energies?&quot; Yet they&#39;re both  there because they&#39;re both a part of you. What you&#39;re trying to do is to give power to  the victim and give compassion and love to the assertive part of you so that both of  them experience a synthesis and a connection inside of yourself, and that&#39;s a really  strong work that you&#39;re experiencing at this time. [chuckles]   <br>

It&#39;s painful because it&#39;s like  opening up a wound to the air, and yet it&#39;s the only way you&#39;re going to heal it. That&#39;s  the other thing I wanted to say. See because you feel such a need to be powerful,  you feel a lot of shame about the victim, and that&#39;s the thing that&#39;s really maybe the  most detrimental because you can&#39;t see yourself in shame. She herself felt an  incredible amount of shame. It&#39;s just that myth. It&#39;s that thing of, well, if a woman gets  raped, and if a woman gets heard, it&#39;s because she asked for it.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: It&#39;s also very Catholic and very Mexican, both of which I am. All the stuff that  you&#39;re saying, for me, it&#39;s just is so cultural too. Women are thought of particularly  around sexuality, so it&#39;s just like the clicks are phenomenon.  <br>  

<strong>Amy</strong>: It&#39;s the kind of thing where you felt, so there&#39;s that real deep, deep, deep little  well of shame in there that when you start feeling like, &quot;Hey, I am a really strong  woman. I&#39;m an incredible person. I am a divine warrior.&quot; That little voice goes, &quot;Oh  yes. Well, I&#39;ll tell you another thing. You are a real complete, total fucked up person.  You were victimized to prove it. On top of it sweetheart, it&#39;s going to happen again.&quot;   <br> 
It&#39;s that thing too. &quot;Don&#39;t let anybody get too close,&quot; because that goes right into the  lover thing. Here, if there&#39;s a person who really loves you and a woman who really  wants to give to you and really wants to totally accept you, then that voice comes up  and says, &quot;Oh yes, she&#39;s going to accept your shame, too.&quot; It&#39;s that feeling of like, &quot;I  can&#39;t let her in. I can&#39;t let her close because if she sees she&#39;ll be repulsed.&quot; She&#39;ll just  look at you and go, &quot;Oh, [unintelligible 00:53:39]. How can I love that?&quot; There&#39;s that  hedge. It&#39;s that little wall you put around yourself and say, &quot;Oh no, oh no.&quot; It feels  very virtuous because it feels like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m doing it for your own good.&quot;   <br> 

It&#39;s like, &quot;I know I&#39;m a shamed woman, so I can&#39;t let you share my shame.&quot; Yet it&#39;s so  bullshit. As you said, it&#39;s so cultural. It&#39;s what we women have been experiencing for  centuries. eons. Also coming from where you&#39;ve come from with the Catholicism and with the Mexican culture and then putting it on top of all the karma, it&#39;s right there,  and yet what this is saying is that you&#39;ve just got to break through it. It&#39;s really  important for you to realize that you cannot feel ashamed of yourself. See, what  happens is then it gets twisted, and you start feeling ashamed of the power.  <br> 

Instead of feeling like, &quot;How can I be ashamed of being a victim? Hey, this is  something I bought into, and I&#39;m not going to buy into it anymore.&quot; Then what  happens is that voice says, &quot;Oh, and you should be ashamed of the fact that you&#39;re  powerful too. What about all the women who aren&#39;t powerful?&quot; How dare you? How  dare you rub their faces in it? Then you feel like, &quot;Oh God. Nothing really that terrible  and horrible and disgusting has happened to me and I somehow escaped in this  lifetime.&quot; Well, it should happen to me, so I should feel ashamed that it hasn&#39;t  happened to me as fully as it could.&quot;   <br> 

It&#39;s really getting you both coming and going. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important for you to  really release the shame and really allow yourself to feel good about the fact that you  are protected, that you are meant to be a warrior, that you are meant to experience  that power, and that you do not have to be victimized ever again in this lifetime. You  will not be victimized ever again if you choose not to be. That&#39;s a really important  karmic lesson for you.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#88C9F2" data-initial-bg-color="#88C9F2" data-tags="Upbringing,Family,Identity"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Upbringing</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Family</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Identity</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:55:46</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>Amy</strong>: Okay. The reason why this is coming up so strongly now is that you are starting about a six-year cycle. That is a very important cycle for you. It&#39;s like you started it  actually years ago. You started it about four years ago. You started this very important Saturn experience, and then you had a respite. You had a rest for about a  year, and now you&#39;re starting it again.   <br> 

First Saturn in the sky as you know is continually moving. You happen to have all  this stuff back to back. As you can see, you have so many planets right here. Now  what happened is that you have Saturn, it passed over your 10th house. The 10th  house is the house of work, and Saturn rules work.   <br> 

When Saturn passes through the 10th house, it says then that you really are  experiencing a real need to deal with your work energy. That was happening, I think  it was around &#39;78. Let me just check. It started at 11 degrees of Leo. You started  experiencing it starting in September of &#39;76, actually. You started experiencing it. It  continued until September of &#39;79. That was over a three-year period. Then you had a  little bit of a respite. Then starting last September, so September of 1980, you  started experiencing it again very intensely, and you will continue experiencing it for  quite a while.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Now, is that specifically around work again, or this is something [crosstalk]?   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: No, now it&#39;s something else. Okay? Now what you&#39;re experiencing is a number  of things because first of all, you have your sun in Libra. You also have Saturn in  Libra, and you have your ascendant in Libra. I know you have your ascendant in  Scorpio, excuse me, but your 12th house is ruled by Libra. Whenever Saturn passes  over the sun or Saturn or the 12th house, it creates a very deep experience. Now  your sun is in the same sign as your Saturn and your Saturn is in your 12th house.  It&#39;s like having three different cycles all back to back, all affecting you all at the same  time. That&#39;s a very intense energy for you. [crosstalk]   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: It started in September?   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: It started in September. Now what it does is it affects you on all these different  level. First of all, it affects you with your sun. What it says is that you are then having  to confront all of your own limitations at this time, and you really have to deal with all  the limitations that you create inside of yourself. Also, you&#39;re in your Saturn return, and the Saturn cycle affects you in a lot of different ways.   <br> 

First of all, one of the ways it affects you is that it really forces you to really let go of your childhood and to accept your adult energy so that all of a sudden, you, Cherrie,  are learning to be an adult in a total way. Now what that means is that you&#39;re  empowering yourself. You&#39;re really accepting your power and your identity on a  whole new level, on a level that you have never experienced before. It&#39;s saying then that you really need to deal with a lot of different issues with your Saturn cycle.   <br> 

The first issue is the issue of letting go of your childhood, which means that all of a  sudden, all these things that you have really associated with your childhood. All the  things that you haven&#39;t felt ready to deal with, you really have to deal with now. It&#39;s really connecting and confronting that energy. Really being able to look at it, really  being able to say, &quot;Yes, this is something that I really have to deal with. This is  something that I really have to connect to. This is something that I really have to  confront inside of myself.&quot; Now the second thing that&#39;s going on with this is the  realization that you also then have to deal with your work.   <br> 

One of the ways that we decide whether a person is an adult or not is by their work,  which is why obviously for so long women were never considered adults. [chuckles]  You are really looking at your work now and deciding what you&#39;re going to do with it. You&#39;ve got three choices. Either what work you&#39;ve been doing so far isn&#39;t your true  work, and now that you&#39;re in your Saturn cycle, you have to let go of it, and you have  to accept your true work, or you&#39;ve just been doing something that was really right for  you, and it was your true work, but now it&#39;s changing, and you&#39;re accepting a new  energy because you&#39;re now going to another level, or what you&#39;ve been doing has  been your true work, but now you&#39;re really broadening it and extending it and  experiencing it on a whole new level.   <br> 

It&#39;s saying that it&#39;s very, very, very important for you to really get in touch with  experiencing that transformational energy and knowing that now is a time for you to  let go of your past and to really accept your future. You do this in a number of ways.  First of all, the first step in the Saturn cycle is figuring out what you really don&#39;t want.  It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re in there cleaning out your psychic closets and you&#39;re saying,  &quot;Okay, well, I don&#39;t need this anymore and I don&#39;t need this anymore and I don&#39;t need  this anymore. I really don&#39;t need to let go of this energy. I don&#39;t need to hold onto this  energy. I can let go of it. I am going to let go of it, and I&#39;m really going to accept a  new energy deep inside of myself.&quot;   <br> 

The next step is figuring out what you really do want. That&#39;s harder because it comes  in dribs and drabs. It&#39;s learning how to be quiet enough and open enough to accept  that energy. It&#39;s learning how to say, &quot;Oh, okay, I&#39;ve really got to learn how to accept  this energy. I&#39;ve really got to be open to accepting this truth inside of myself and  knowing that this is exactly the right energy for myself.&quot;   <br> 

It&#39;s slowly and surely getting in touch with the energy and learning how to be open to  that energy in a really good way. Now the third thing that happens with the Saturn  cycle is because the etheric body of adulthood, consciousness of adulthood is  actually connecting to your real physical body. You&#39;re really changing your  connection to other people who used to be adults to you. Your connection to your  parents can change because they&#39;re no longer your parents. It&#39;s like you are now an  adult. You are peers now.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#99AFF2" data-initial-bg-color="#99AFF2" data-tags="Family"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99E6FF"> Personal Development And Identity </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Family</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">01:03:24</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style=""><strong>Amy</strong>: One of the things that happens in the Saturn Cycle is you come face-to-face with  your own mortality because children never die. Children don&#39;t die. Even when they&#39;re  dying, they don&#39;t die. It&#39;s because they don&#39;t have a real sense of their mortality, but  adults die. All of a sudden, now, you&#39;re really confronting that mortality, and you&#39;re  grieving for the loss of your childhood. It&#39;s really easy in your Saturn cycle to  experience a great deal of grief, and you&#39;ve just got to let it come right through you.  Also, you&#39;re grieving for the death of your parents no matter what shape your parents  are in. Whether they&#39;re alive or not, whether they&#39;re healthy or not, you&#39;re going to  grieve for their death because they&#39;re no longer your parents.  <br> 

You realize that you are an adult, they&#39;re adults, they are dying. That&#39;s a real intense  energy for people to deal with. Another thing that happens is that you really have to  deal with your own insecurity because being in your Saturn cycle, it&#39;s really, really  easy to feel insecure. It&#39;s that feeling of like, &quot;Oh, everything&#39;s changing. I&#39;m in a  kaleidoscope now. I want everything to be the same. I want everything to be secure,  and yet, somehow it isn&#39;t.&quot; One of the things you&#39;re really working on is you&#39;re really  allowing yourself to break through that insecurity. You&#39;re really, really allowing  yourself to know what it is that you have to do.   <br> 

You&#39;re really being able to say, &quot;Okay, I know that what it is that I have to do is really  accept the truth inside of myself. I know that what I have to do is really be able to  know that my only security is my truth, is my destiny, and I can&#39;t try to pin it on  anything else.&quot; It is an insecure time. It is a painful time, but it&#39;s also a time of  releasing the past and accepting your true identity.   <br> 

Now the fact that Saturn will soon be moving through your 12th house. Right now, it&#39;s  still in your 11th house. It&#39;s a little bit of a respite, and it will start getting into your  12th house. Let&#39;s see, it has to hit 13 degrees. It&#39;ll be in your 12th house by your-- let&#39;s see, is it by [unintelligible 01:05:55]? No, it&#39;s by next October. It&#39;s October of  &#39;81. It&#39;ll go back into your 12th house.   <br> 

Starting in October of &#39;81, you&#39;re going to feel as if circumstances are forcing you to  release negative energy, to release your limitations. It&#39;s almost as if this really strong  force comes down into you and takes this really high-powered flashlight, and is  looking in all the corners and under the bed and in the closets and saying, &quot;Okay,  now you got to really deal with this shit. You&#39;ve got to really deal with this shit,&quot; yet it  affects you outwardly, externally.   <br> 

As an example, one person I knew who was going through this. Her lover was  someone she really didn&#39;t want to be with yet she was really holding onto it because  she didn&#39;t want to hurt her lover&#39;s feelings. Then when Saturn was in her 12th house,  her lover said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be with you anymore.&quot; At first, of course, the woman  was feeling really frustrated and really angry.   <br> 

Then she realized what a fool she was. It was like, &quot;Oh God, I feel relieved.&quot; This is  what you really wanted. It&#39;s that kind of energy where sometimes things happen, and  yet when they happen, at first, you might feel a real frustration or a real anger, but  then you realize it&#39;s exactly what you want it to happen. It&#39;s this thing of like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m  so pleased. I&#39;m so thankful that this happened. Now I don&#39;t have to carry it anymore.&quot;   <br> 

Realize it&#39;s starting in October of &#39;81, you will be going through this period of time in  which external circumstances are forcing you to grow, and yet you know that that is  the best thing that could happen to you. You realize that all the things that are  happening, they&#39;re the things that you really wanted to happen, and yet at the time, it  might feel very scary to you and might feel very difficult to you. It&#39;s really getting in  touch with accepting that energy and knowing that that is absolutely the right thing  and that you really can accept it-   <br>

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> See, the part of me that predominates is the right brain. You know, whichever palm you put over first when you do like that? Okay you’re left-brained–I mean–you’re a right-handed person. I’m a left-handed person even though I write with my right hand.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> And when you grab for something, do you grab with your left hand?

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Um, up until it broke. I was doing most of the things with my left hand but then I broke this arm so then I started doing things with this right hand.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> So would you tell me that you’re left handed or right handed?

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Right now I’m right handed but naturally I’m ambidextrous. When I was little…

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> When you were born, when you were born were you left-handed?

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Yes… I think I was.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> This is your left hand?

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> This was in a cast so it&#39;s a little more wrinkled. But why don’t you read my right hand since that’s what I am now? They’re very different, no?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Well the thing is that whichever hand you use is the hand that is the manifestation of your life as you&#39;re living it.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> mmhmm I’m right-handed.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Your left hand, or your other hand--the hand that you use less--is a reflection of the potentials and the dynamics that you needed to work out in this life. For example, let&#39;s say it&#39;s your left hand. What’s written on your left hand is the markings of your spirit, the things that your spirit needed to work out, the things that your spirit wanted to work out. It’s a marking of the progression you’ve made up until this point–your spirit has made up until this point. The markings on your right hand, or the hand that you use the most, is the marking–marks the progression that you’ve made in this life.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Okay do it on the left.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> And…that in this lifetime instead of there being the kind of, hmm…let’s say, the anguish of your early life, emotional life, affected your life and affected your health in the past. In this life you were able to make some kind of breaks away from your sibling, your life, your mother, your father, your sisters your brothers your uncles your aunts, those that you were raised with as a child. You have made breaks of…. They have forced you–or– you have become more independent. Um, you..it was like a forcible…through an act of will you have been able to become more independent as I’m reading this. See but this…I wonder if I should be reading this in this manner… See your fate line is coming in here. Now if we were reading your hand the other way around, I would say that– See my mother knows how to do this better than I do.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Yes.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> It shows an independence of will you might say.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> mmhmm, I’m very willful.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> But your left hand shows even more of an independence of will. And not only that, it shows that you have had a destiny that has affected the lives of many other people up until this point. And it looks like this is right at the point that you’re at right now. I mean, I don’t know which hand is the present hand, you know what I mean, cause you say you’re ambidextrous. Um- it&#39;s so weird. This hand is so weird &#39;cause, um-it shows--this shows a very strong will power. A very strong creation of one’s own destiny. Not like, if this line here were coming from this side here and coming up like mine does, this shows a life that is very much determined by other people. The whims of others or the desires of others–that sort of thing, But this shows a creative willpower–act of will which is carving out your destiny. And it also shows a destiny which is um…. Which is having a great influence on other people’s lives. I mean this is about, shows the life of [inaudible] Someone in their thirties, late thirties. But this…

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> What you came into the world with.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Okay.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Okay, so if we do it that way, it shows that you had, let’s see…that you have an independence of spirit. You came in with more of an independence of spirit, although stuff to work with your–you had stuff to work out with your family that you came into the world with, but that there was this independence of spirit there. You had not lived a kind of life which had had a great effect on the lives of other people.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Why is it unusual?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Because you know it’s interesting because it comes up and it&#39;s connected to this blessing you have here. I think that’s the creativity. And it comes up– ‘cause usually the health line begins here.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Sí, yeah this is creativity and this is the finger of Apollo so this would be creativity. This is communication. Mercury. No?

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> I mean that’s probably something else

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> I see it as a potential to experience. A potential to be able to have a deep loving connection with another human being or with people in general, but it’s not quite actualized yet, it&#39;s like more of a potential. And it has to break from this romanticism stuff, because the romanticism stuff keeps you, will keep you distant from people.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> mmhmm

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> This coming in between these two fingers shows an ability to love in a complete way in a realistic way.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Oh. so this line in the heart line that goes off, that is in romanticism? And the one that curves between the Jupiter and Saturn finger is the one that is the more complete, more whole one?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> mmhmm

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Hmmm!

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> And I think a healthier kind of love. And see how it’s kind of coming in here but it&#39;s not quite actualized yet.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> mmhmm

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> So, that’s probably something that you&#39;re working on now. [long pause] The romanticism stuff I think may give you a tendency to be kind of narrow-minded about some things.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Hmm! So maybe that’s what’s showing up here. You have some relationship lines coming in here.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> You haven’t met them yet.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> So there’s only two lines?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Well, there could be more coming in. The lines are always changing, you know? More come, some come, some go.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> And what are the ones that are like this?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> I don’t really know how to read those. They’re not good enough to discern which things mean stuff and which things don’t. I think that’s all that I can do.

This is what we decided you were born with, huh?

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Yes.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> This one shows that you haven’t traveled as much. That you were more sure of yourself, but maybe almost…

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Arrogant?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Lacksadaisical in your approach to life. And you know things were more or less simple. Clearcut. Black and white. You know, for you. And that your health wasn’t as good–physically. That your attitude toward life, maybe your kind of indolence caused you to be lazy about your health and that may have affected your life, but it didn’t really affect your ability to love or your–the way you thought about things. Things were pretty clear, black and white. You did some traveling. You still had a blessing around your creativity and you were a very sensuous person. But you have done a lot of growing in this life if you read it this way. I think you should.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Yeah I think so too.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> And um you know, you’ve done a lot more traveling. You&#39;ve chosen to come into a family where there would be a lot of complicated issues for you to deal with. It’s enabled you to love a great deal more and in more complexity, but you still have a lot of stuff to work out about love. You have more of a capacity to love now than you did before. But that’s still something you’re kind of stopped at. You are much stronger–you’ve been forced to develop a willpower that enables you to go beyond yourself, and it&#39;s caused you to have a lot of experiences which are going to affect every aspect of your life but you have a very strong mind and will power. And actually your health is much better, your constitution, because of the changes that you’ve made in your life and family.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> I don’t know, it&#39;s just someone told me that. You’ve got lots of creativity. No? What are these?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Yeah, same thing.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Did your mother tell you?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> It’s communication. No, uh uh. But I had a lot of stuff to work out about love. And…

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Well this–

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> mmhmm. I came in with a good mind but my intellect is not as developed in this life as I had the potential to have it be.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> I think its very developed, no?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Well, I mean because of the work I do it forces me to think but actually I had kind of a traumatic childhood. See I have these nervous energy lines that come up past my life line. And they cross my head line and make this island here and continue over and cross my heart line and reach up to my health line here.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> And these are all nervous lines?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> This is a nervous energy line that crosses all the way over here, and it makes an island here which shows a type of insanity that occurred, and I think that affected my ability–my intellectual abilities–because this line is not as long as it is on my other hand. On my other hand it comes all the way to here. It stops here. And it’s also not clear, and that break in it–see how yours is clear and straight? That shows that you can think clearly. So I had some damage here in my life that I have to overcome. And here, you can see some of the stuff around my heart.

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> Bueno, and this is your health line?

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> Mmhmm

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> It’s so straight. So straight…

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> I know, but it&#39;s not good that it&#39;s there. The less of a health line you have, the better off you are. Which line, which hand is this? Your right hand?

 <br> <strong>GA:</strong> This is my right hand. What I came into the world with.

 <br> <strong>CS:</strong> And this is your left hand.

<p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="">GA: What I want to do is I want to take you through the pattern and beginning with card number one which represents the interaction between you and Jane, and probably between you and the way you interact with most people. This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there&#39;s a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she&#39;s looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She&#39;s looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from. She is the only one in the royalty cards that looks towards the past.

 <br> SG: Is that right?

 <br> GA: Ah-ha. The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it&#39;s a process of expanding consciously in your head.

She represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it&#39;s a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.

The vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?

 <br> SG: mmhmm! I realize that.

 <br> GA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you&#39;re going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She&#39;s wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what&#39;s going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet. She&#39;s like real centered, content, she knows what she wants, she knows herself and she&#39;s just like emotionally there.

 <br> SG: Good! Good.

 <br> GA: Basically the message is to do something aesthetically pleasing about your surroundings and take care of your health and also maybe go out and buy a dress or cut your hair. It&#39;s a card that says it&#39;s time to beautify your-- or get something for her to do that. Do you have any questions about this card?

Am I taking too long?

 <br> GA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

There&#39;s a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called. To do this, you need to take into account your love nature, the Venus aspect that the way you relate to people and the way you-- Como se dice?

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I hide a lot.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I’ve always felt a little bit like that, but its sort of like egotistic to think that I think for me. But hearing somebody else say it-

 <br> <strong>JL</strong>: Why is that egotistical? I mean, you can be very giving, and give yourself to a cause, and have passions that are very strong. Because you do have them.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: [inaudible]?

 <br> <strong>JL</strong>: [inaudible] and you&#39;re–on that same path now, that youve been on since that revision since you were 28, 29, 27, whenever that was.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Wow [laughs]. Is that possible to do?

 <br> <strong>JL</strong>: Why not? There are gonna be three possibilities there. In other words, what I’m saying to you, in your 46th year or so, give or take a year, there will be another either career or moral, or interior decision where you’re going to have to revise and revamp again. And where you will.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Those are always painful.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes

I want you to know that. I think that other people decide, but don’t let them decide for you. Don&#39;t let them look at you and decide you should be a nun.
