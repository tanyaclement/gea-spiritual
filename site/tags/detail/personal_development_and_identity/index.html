There&#39;s a thing about Pluto where there&#39;s a constant need to transform yourself, move to another level. It&#39;s like the phoenix, is that symbol.

A potential to be able to have a deep loving connection with another human being or with people in general, but it’s not quite actualized yet, it&#39;s like more of a potential. And it has to break from this romanticism stuff, because the romanticism stuff keeps you, will keep you distant from people. And this other line here shows another direction that you have in you to act out and it shows like the come up real high. See how it’s kinda comin up in there?

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         mmhmm

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         And I think a healthier kind of love. And see how it’s kind of coming in here but it&#39;s not quite actualized yet.

That your attitude toward life, maybe your kind of indolence caused you to be lazy about your health and that may have affected your life, but it didn’t really affect your ability to love or your–the way you thought about things. Things were pretty clear, black and white. You did some traveling. You still had a blessing around your creativity and you were a very sensuous person.

You&#39;ve chosen to come into a family where there would be a lot of complicated issues for you to deal with. It’s enabled you to love a great deal more and in more complexity, but you still have a lot of stuff to work out about love. You have more of a capacity to love now than you did before. But that’s still something you’re kind of stopped at. You are much stronger–you’ve been forced to develop a willpower that enables you to go beyond yourself, and it&#39;s caused you to have a lot of experiences which are going to affect every aspect of your life but you have a very strong mind and will power. And actually your health is much better, your constitution, because of the changes that you’ve made in your life and family.

It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I&#39;ve been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It&#39;s  been a lot of work.

When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It&#39;s not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it&#39;s not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There&#39;s something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They&#39;re different for the different aspects, and they&#39;re also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it&#39;s one of the  inner planets, it&#39;s one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It&#39;s too past Saturn and Mars as one. 

                 <br>                 This side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it&#39;s with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it&#39;s inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don&#39;t know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.

                 <br>                 How that goes into your sun, is first of all, that&#39;s really connected to your sense of  self. There&#39;s two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it&#39;s generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into.

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, it&#39;s there. When you&#39;re looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it&#39;s different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It&#39;s the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It&#39;s in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I&#39;ve done drugs. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, it&#39;s a drug thing. It&#39;s such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I think I do that too. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto&#39;s type spirituality is a very different- - It&#39;s much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It&#39;s more occult, it&#39;s more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It&#39;s  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

It spends approximately 20 years in this sign, and so it affects  whole generations, and it&#39;s very interesting stuff. You look historically at the different  Pluto transits, it&#39;s when Pluto was in Cancer, was the Depression. When Pluto was in  Leo was the discovery of atomic energy, and when it was in Virgo was drugs, all the  drug culture stuff. Lots of people getting into health stuff, all of a sudden. It sounds like an incredible transformation of consciousness in some way in relation to that  particular area.

It makes it harder in that it&#39;s  sometimes very hard for you to get a handle on where you end, where other people  begin, and where your responsibility to other people ends. Also, in terms of psychic  stuff, it means that you need to consciously develop psychic protection because the  world rushes in when you align.

It&#39;s also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn&#39;t really get rolling until you&#39;re older. People  are much more like their moons when you&#39;re kids. 

You grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it&#39;s much more, you have no power and you&#39;re in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger.

                 <br>                 GA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

There&#39;s a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called. To do this, you need to take into account your love nature, the Venus aspect that the way you relate to people and the way you-- Como se dice?
