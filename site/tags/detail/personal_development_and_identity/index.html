                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         Hmm! So maybe that’s what’s showing up here. You have some relationship lines coming in here. See it looks like one towards the end of your life that’s that’s a marriage it looks pretty good, and then another one in the middle of your life that looks…that’s all there already in marked in your hand.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         hmm…Wow

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         This one in the end of your life looks like it’s a real positive, &quot;up&quot; relationship, and the other one looks like you go through a lot of shit together.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Yeah, I think this line must be me and Randy. We had real hard times. This one. I don’t know who the other one is.

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         Well, there could be more coming in. The lines are always changing, you know? More come, some come, some go.

You know, for you. And that your health wasn’t as good–physically. That your attitude toward life, maybe your kind of indolence caused you to be lazy about your health and that may have affected your life, but it didn’t really affect your ability to love or your–the way you thought about things. Things were pretty clear, black and white. You did some traveling. You still had a blessing around your creativity and you were a very sensuous person. But you have done a lot of growing in this life if you read it this way. I think you should.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Yeah I think so too.

You&#39;ve chosen to come into a family where there would be a lot of complicated issues for you to deal with. It’s enabled you to love a great deal more and in more complexity, but you still have a lot of stuff to work out about love. You have more of a capacity to love now than you did before. But that’s still something you’re kind of stopped at. You are much stronger–you’ve been forced to develop a willpower that enables you to go beyond yourself, and it&#39;s caused you to have a lot of experiences which are going to affect every aspect of your life but you have a very strong mind and will power. And actually your health is much better, your constitution, because of the changes that you’ve made in your life and family.

This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there&#39;s a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she&#39;s looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She&#39;s looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from. She is the only one in the royalty cards that looks towards the past.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that right?

                 <br>                 GA: Ah-ha. The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it&#39;s a process of expanding consciously in your head.

She represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it&#39;s a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.

The vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?

                 <br>                 SG: mmhmm! I realize that.

                 <br>                 GA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you&#39;re going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She&#39;s wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what&#39;s going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet.

Am I taking too long?

                 <br>                 GA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

There&#39;s a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called. To do this, you need to take into account your love nature, the Venus aspect that the way you relate to people and the way you-- Como se dice?
