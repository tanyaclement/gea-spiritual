                 <br>                 Pluto in 8th house. The energy in both of those are similar. It&#39;s like the 8th house is the Pluto of the houses, kind of. It means that in some way there&#39;s a lot of emphasis in your life on transformation, a lot. There&#39;s a thing about Pluto where there&#39;s a constant need to transform yourself, move to another level. It&#39;s like the phoenix, is that symbol.

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         And when you grab for something, do you grab with your left hand?

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Um, up until it broke. I was doing most of the things with my left hand but then I broke this arm so then I started doing things with this right hand.

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         So would you tell me that you’re left handed or right handed?

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Right now I’m right handed but naturally I’m ambidextrous. When I was little…

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         When you were born, when you were born were you left-handed?

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Yes… I think I was.

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         This is your left hand?

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         Well the thing is that whichever hand you use is the hand that is the manifestation of your life as you&#39;re living it.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         mmhmm I’m right-handed.

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         Your left hand, or your other hand--the hand that you use less--is a reflection of the potentials and the dynamics that you needed to work out in this life. For example, let&#39;s say it&#39;s your left hand. What’s written on your left hand is the markings of your spirit, the things that your spirit needed to work out, the things that your spirit wanted to work out. It’s a marking of the progression you’ve made up until this point–your spirit has made up until this point. The markings on your right hand, or the hand that you use the most, is the marking–marks the progression that you’ve made in this life.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Okay do it on the left.

You have made breaks of…. They have forced you–or– you have become more independent.

This represents your karmic link or why you came together, what you have to learn from each other. They&#39;re beautiful. This represents your career and creativity, the receptivity. Beautiful. This is your decision-making processes, delegating duties and all that. God, you don&#39;t have any problems in that respect. The inner environmental process and the outer.

                 <br>                 SG: Turn this one over?

                 <br>                 GA: It doesn&#39;t really matter. In this case reverse just means that there&#39;s a greater focus on the card. It&#39;s beautiful. This is your outer environment you work with. This represents yourself, your total self in relation to all these questions and who you are and how you see yourself. Beautiful. This is your test, your lesson. What you need to breakthrough or--

                 <br>                 SG: With swords! Ten!

                 <br>                 GA: That&#39;s one negative card out of the whole bunch. Now the last one is the outcome card. Wow. First of all a general look at the cards, you have one, two, three, four, five trump cards. That&#39;s very unusual. Trump cards are gifts to you. Even the hangmen their energies had come to you. The royalty you have, one, two, three. The royalties are the cards that represent actually doing and acting on things. The minor arcana are potentials. Things that you can act on. These people really act on them. The queens and the princesses or defenders. The frontal people they face you, they defend. The knights and the princesses are hunters, the more aggressive kind. In your deck there are knights in the Waite deck but there&#39;re not any princesses.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s right.

                 <br>                 GA: There&#39;re just kings, so you have to make the transition. The negative card represents thoughts or self-rule, that what you do is, you do a mental trip on yourself. The outcome card is the card of synthesis of arcana.

                 <br>                 GA: This is the card of the hierophant, and it&#39;s the card of teaching and learning. Especially around occult mysteries. Do you know what her birthday is by any chance?

For example, I&#39;m a double lover, but in my numerology, I have two double sevens and a double nine, the hermit and chariot. Sometimes people are in a growth year that is erected to this card. The number five, or that five years ago, something happened between the two of you.

                 <br>                 SG: It was our-- Yes, exactly [laughs]. That&#39;s wonderful. That&#39;s very fun. Very fun.

                 <br>                 GA: What I want to do is, I want to figure out what her growth year is. It&#39;s amazing. Two lovers living together, double lovers. It works, huh?

                 <br>                 SG: Actually, we don&#39;t live together.

                 <br>                 SG: With Jane. Together?

                 <br>                 GA: Yeah. This is the pregnant lady in the deck. She is the princess of disks. She has gone, walked up the top of the mountain, gone through the briar patch. All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You&#39;re in the clear. You&#39;re out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you&#39;ve gone through. That the both of you have gone through. Again, the Aries, moving forward, the Aries horns, the ram horns, moving forward with awareness.

                 <br>                 There&#39;s a snake, and she&#39;s carrying it on her shoulders, and it looks like a cloak and it&#39;s asleep. She&#39;s near getting ready to do this transformation, to give birth to a new identity. Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn&#39;t been able to be with her, because you&#39;ve worked through all these things.

                 <br>                 The long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It&#39;s sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I&#39;m loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.

                 <br>                 The other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she&#39;s touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She&#39;s holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it&#39;s horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.&quot;

                 <br>                 SG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?

                 <br>                 GA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it&#39;s inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you&#39;ve got things in control. You&#39;ve got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It&#39;s the earth symbol. She&#39;s a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She&#39;s sort of like three-dimensional. I don&#39;t know.

                 <br>                 SG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What&#39;s the background Gloria?

                 <br>                 GA: Would you like some--?

                 <br>                 SG: Yes, I would love. What&#39;s the background? Is it mountains?

                 <br>                 GA: Yes, she&#39;s walked through the mountains. It&#39;s been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She&#39;s gone through the dark forest.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she&#39;s got there?

                 <br>                 GA: That&#39;s part of the snake.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a snake?

                 <br>                 GA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you&#39;re going to give birth to a project that&#39;s financially rewarding, or you&#39;re going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I&#39;m not sure.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s good. For sure it&#39;s not financial. [laughs] I don&#39;t see that at all. It must be the other.

                 <br>                 GA: Yes. She looks a little tired. It&#39;s been a long haul.

                 <br>                 SG: Mm-hmm.

And not only that, it shows that you have had a destiny that has affected the lives of many other people up until this point. And it looks like this is right at the point that you’re at right now. I mean, I don’t know which hand is the present hand, you know what I mean, cause you say you’re ambidextrous. Um- it&#39;s so weird. This hand is so weird &#39;cause, um-it shows--this shows a very strong will power. A very strong creation of one’s own destiny. Not like, if this line here were coming from this side here and coming up like mine does, this shows a life that is very much determined by other people. The whims of others or the desires of others–that sort of thing, But this shows a creative willpower–act of will which is carving out your destiny. And it also shows a destiny which is um…. Which is having a great influence on other people’s lives. I mean this is about, shows the life of [inaudible] Someone in their thirties, late thirties. But this…

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         So you think this might be…

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         I see it as a potential to experience. A potential to be able to have a deep loving connection with another human being or with people in general, but it’s not quite actualized yet, it&#39;s like more of a potential. And it has to break from this romanticism stuff, because the romanticism stuff keeps you, will keep you distant from people. And this other line here shows another direction that you have in you to act out and it shows like the come up real high. See how it’s kinda comin up in there?

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         mmhmm

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         This coming in between these two fingers shows an ability to love in a complete way in a realistic way.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Oh. so this line in the heart line that goes off, that is in romanticism? And the one that curves between the Jupiter and Saturn finger is the one that is the more complete, more whole one?

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         mmhmm

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         Hmmm!

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         And I think a healthier kind of love. And see how it’s kind of coming in here but it&#39;s not quite actualized yet.

That your attitude toward life, maybe your kind of indolence caused you to be lazy about your health and that may have affected your life, but it didn’t really affect your ability to love or your–the way you thought about things. Things were pretty clear, black and white. You did some traveling. You still had a blessing around your creativity and you were a very sensuous person.

It’s enabled you to love a great deal more and in more complexity, but you still have a lot of stuff to work out about love. You have more of a capacity to love now than you did before. But that’s still something you’re kind of stopped at. You are much stronger–you’ve been forced to develop a willpower that enables you to go beyond yourself, and it&#39;s caused you to have a lot of experiences which are going to affect every aspect of your life but you have a very strong mind and will power. And actually your health is much better, your constitution, because of the changes that you’ve made in your life and family.

She is ruled by Aries, and there&#39;s a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she&#39;s looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She&#39;s looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from.

It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

There&#39;s a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called. To do this, you need to take into account your love nature, the Venus aspect that the way you relate to people and the way you-- Como se dice?

But um, I’d have to get a palmistry book and study up on this cause you&#39;ve got some designs in here that I don’t know how to read.         </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#88C9F2" data-initial-bg-color="#88C9F2" data-tags="Location,Notes"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#88C9F2"> Research And Analysis Tools </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Location</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Notes</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:26:41</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">          <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="">        Title: &quot;Creativity Is a Coping Strategy,&quot; A View From the Loft 13 (1), 1990 August | Location: Box: 59 | Folder: 22        </p>          </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#88C9F2" data-initial-bg-color="#88C9F2" data-tags="Plática"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#88C9F2"> Research And Analysis Tools </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Plática</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:27:43</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">         [inaudible; a woman speaking loudly]

On my other hand it comes all the way to here. It stops here. And it’s also not clear, and that break in it–see how yours is clear and straight? That shows that you can think clearly.

                 <br>                 SG: With Jane. Together?

                 <br>                 GA: Yeah. This is the pregnant lady in the deck. She is the princess of disks. She has gone, walked up the top of the mountain, gone through the briar patch. All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You&#39;re in the clear. You&#39;re out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you&#39;ve gone through. That the both of you have gone through. Again, the Aries, moving forward, the Aries horns, the ram horns, moving forward with awareness.

                 <br>                 There&#39;s a snake, and she&#39;s carrying it on her shoulders, and it looks like a cloak and it&#39;s asleep. She&#39;s near getting ready to do this transformation, to give birth to a new identity. Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn&#39;t been able to be with her, because you&#39;ve worked through all these things.

                 <br>                 The long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It&#39;s sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I&#39;m loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.

                 <br>                 The other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she&#39;s touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She&#39;s holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it&#39;s horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.&quot;

                 <br>                 SG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?

                 <br>                 GA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it&#39;s inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you&#39;ve got things in control. You&#39;ve got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It&#39;s the earth symbol. She&#39;s a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She&#39;s sort of like three-dimensional. I don&#39;t know.

                 <br>                 SG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What&#39;s the background Gloria?

                 <br>                 GA: Would you like some--?

                 <br>                 SG: Yes, I would love. What&#39;s the background? Is it mountains?

                 <br>                 GA: Yes, she&#39;s walked through the mountains. It&#39;s been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She&#39;s gone through the dark forest.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she&#39;s got there?

                 <br>                 GA: That&#39;s part of the snake.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a snake?

                 <br>                 GA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you&#39;re going to give birth to a project that&#39;s financially rewarding, or you&#39;re going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I&#39;m not sure.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s good. For sure it&#39;s not financial. [laughs] I don&#39;t see that at all. It must be the other.

This represents your karmic link or why you came together, what you have to learn from each other. They&#39;re beautiful. This represents your career and creativity, the receptivity. Beautiful. This is your decision-making processes, delegating duties and all that. God, you don&#39;t have any problems in that respect. The inner environmental process and the outer.

First of all a general look at the cards, you have one, two, three, four, five trump cards. That&#39;s very unusual. Trump cards are gifts to you. Even the hangmen their energies had come to you. The royalty you have, one, two, three. The royalties are the cards that represent actually doing and acting on things. The minor arcana are potentials. Things that you can act on. These people really act on them. The queens and the princesses or defenders. The frontal people they face you, they defend. The knights and the princesses are hunters, the more aggressive kind. In your deck there are knights in the Waite deck but there&#39;re not any princesses.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s right.

                 <br>                 GA: There&#39;re just kings, so you have to make the transition. The negative card represents thoughts or self-rule, that what you do is, you do a mental trip on yourself. The outcome card is the card of synthesis of arcana.

This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there&#39;s a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she&#39;s looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She&#39;s looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from. She is the only one in the royalty cards that looks towards the past.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that right?

                 <br>                 GA: Ah-ha. The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it&#39;s a process of expanding consciously in your head.

She represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it&#39;s a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.

The vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?

                 <br>                 SG: mmhmm! I realize that.

                 <br>                 GA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you&#39;re going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She&#39;s wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what&#39;s going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet. She&#39;s like real centered, content, she knows what she wants, she knows herself and she&#39;s just like emotionally there.

There will be a child, either a neighbor&#39;s, or maybe she&#39;ll be in the bus and she&#39;ll see a child in the bus or in the park, maybe a niece, or somebody. There&#39;ll be a child that will trigger that in her, of owning her childlike innocence and playfulness.

                 <br>                 The child will represent Horace, like the father represented Osiris. Isis in this picture is a contemporary woman. The man was older, the child was younger. Isis is a contemporary woman and someone that&#39;s close to her age. This woman will open up vistas in the occult, in maybe tarot or the i ching, or maybe a reading that she had. Some psychic thing will be mirrored to her by a contemporary woman who&#39;s into the occult, or into the mysteries, or spirituality. When she recognizes that woman, then it&#39;s like recognizing her potential to get into the occult and her inner spirituality. Basically, this is the part of the family of Osiris, Isis, and Horace the baby. Isis is down here, holding a sword between her thighs. Isis is represented by the hierophant and Horace is the five-pointed star.

The learning teaching situations don&#39;t have to be just about the occult. They can be sexual or personal or emotional or intellectual, but this is the energy of bringing to you those things that teach. You usually teach what you want to learn.

                 <br>                 SG: Nine.

The snake represents regeneration and rebirth. These memories of our experiences or lessons, whatever they are, she has the ability to go through them and be transformed. The symbol of the snake. The dove is the symbol of wisdom, peace. Wisdom if the little bird is carrying an olive twig. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an olive twig here, so this is just peace and love. This thing in the background. One, two, three, four, five, it just represents all of the perceptions, mental, emotional, spiritual. And the key?

                 <br>                 SG: With Jane. Together?

                 <br>                 GA: Yeah. This is the pregnant lady in the deck. She is the princess of disks. She has gone, walked up the top of the mountain, gone through the briar patch. All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You&#39;re in the clear. You&#39;re out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you&#39;ve gone through. That the both of you have gone through. Again, the Aries, moving forward, the Aries horns, the ram horns, moving forward with awareness.

                 <br>                 There&#39;s a snake, and she&#39;s carrying it on her shoulders, and it looks like a cloak and it&#39;s asleep. She&#39;s near getting ready to do this transformation, to give birth to a new identity. Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn&#39;t been able to be with her, because you&#39;ve worked through all these things.

                 <br>                 The long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It&#39;s sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I&#39;m loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.

                 <br>                 The other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she&#39;s touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She&#39;s holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it&#39;s horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.&quot;

                 <br>                 SG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?

                 <br>                 GA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it&#39;s inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you&#39;ve got things in control. You&#39;ve got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It&#39;s the earth symbol. She&#39;s a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She&#39;s sort of like three-dimensional. I don&#39;t know.

                 <br>                 SG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What&#39;s the background Gloria?

                 <br>                 GA: Would you like some--?

                 <br>                 SG: Yes, I would love. What&#39;s the background? Is it mountains?

                 <br>                 GA: Yes, she&#39;s walked through the mountains. It&#39;s been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She&#39;s gone through the dark forest.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she&#39;s got there?

                 <br>                 GA: That&#39;s part of the snake.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a snake?

                 <br>                 GA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you&#39;re going to give birth to a project that&#39;s financially rewarding, or you&#39;re going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I&#39;m not sure.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s good. For sure it&#39;s not financial. [laughs] I don&#39;t see that at all. It must be the other.

                 <br>                 GA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called. To do this, you need to take into account your love nature, the Venus aspect that the way you relate to people and the way you-- Como se dice?

It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

There&#39;s a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called.

There&#39;s a thing about Pluto where there&#39;s a constant need to transform yourself, move to another level. It&#39;s like the phoenix, is that symbol.

What I imagine what would happen when the transit actually occurs, which will be in October, will be that it&#39;ll be a time when it&#39;ll be real- The inspiration won&#39;t come easy. It&#39;ll probably-- Actually, it&#39;d be a great time to do work that depends less on inspiration and depends more on hard work. The kind of intellectual, like be it editing stuff or retyping stuff to send out somewhere or organizing your notes on something where there-- or gathering information for something, or the kind of stuff that&#39;s much more of the discipline, nitty-gritty kind of stuff.

It&#39;s not-- Anything that&#39;s going on in the 12th house, especially when it&#39;s near the cusp, it&#39;s a lot. That&#39;s what I was saying. It feels like being premenstrual, sort of. You can almost figure out what&#39;s-- it&#39;s like almost there. Stuff is rumbling around in the background. It&#39;s imminent, this feeling of imminence and of something that is happening and you don&#39;t have very much control over and you can&#39;t really quite figure out.

                 <br>                 It could be good in terms of writing and could be real interesting to just maybe to try and actually focus on using imagery or relying more on imagery that comes from a real subconscious source for a while and playing around with that because there&#39;s a lot of stuff going on on that  level, at the moment, and a lot of flashes.

In terms of how to deal with it. Anything that has to do with the 12th house, the only way to deal with it is to let go, to be able to let go and let it be. Pay attention, but let it be.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Si. That&#39;s so hard for me to do.

All that stuff.

Maybe you had been doing growth in your own on yourself, so now in this life you have had a very emotionally heavy relationship with your mom and your dad.

That your attitude toward life, maybe your kind of indolence caused you to be lazy about your health and that may have affected your life, but it didn’t really affect your ability to love or your–the way you thought about things. Things were pretty clear, black and white. You did some traveling. You still had a blessing around your creativity and you were a very sensuous person.

It’s enabled you to love a great deal more and in more complexity, but you still have a lot of stuff to work out about love. You have more of a capacity to love now than you did before. But that’s still something you’re kind of stopped at. You are much stronger–you’ve been forced to develop a willpower that enables you to go beyond yourself, and it&#39;s caused you to have a lot of experiences which are going to affect every aspect of your life but you have a very strong mind and will power. And actually your health is much better, your constitution, because of the changes that you’ve made in your life and family.

First of all a general look at the cards, you have one, two, three, four, five trump cards. That&#39;s very unusual. Trump cards are gifts to you. Even the hangmen their energies had come to you. The royalty you have, one, two, three. The royalties are the cards that represent actually doing and acting on things. The minor arcana are potentials. Things that you can act on. These people really act on them. The queens and the princesses or defenders. The frontal people they face you, they defend. The knights and the princesses are hunters, the more aggressive kind. In your deck there are knights in the Waite deck but there&#39;re not any princesses.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s right.

                 <br>                 GA: There&#39;re just kings, so you have to make the transition. The negative card represents thoughts or self-rule, that what you do is, you do a mental trip on yourself. The outcome card is the card of synthesis of arcana.

This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there&#39;s a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she&#39;s looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She&#39;s looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from.

For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it&#39;s a process of expanding consciously in your head.

They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She&#39;s wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else.

The learning teaching situations don&#39;t have to be just about the occult. They can be sexual or personal or emotional or intellectual, but this is the energy of bringing to you those things that teach. You usually teach what you want to learn. There are four other times during the year when this potential comes through the most. This is during Scorpio the eagle, Aquarius the man, Taurus the bull, and Leo the lion. Those are the four times that are very-- what is the word? Propitious.

Because Taurus is really-- it&#39;s not just planning, and it&#39;s not just dreaming and thinking about things. It&#39;s really doing, really carrying it through. It&#39;s earthing it. There&#39;s three Earths, Virgo, Taurus, and Capricorn, and of those three, the Taurus is the sign that really does manifest things.

                 <br>                 SG: hah. Two of them. Is it two? Yes.

                 <br>                 GA: Yes. They had to do with hearing. With a sense of hearing. A symbol for that and also for long memories. These snails here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, means that she&#39;s been pierced by five. How many did I say?

                 <br>                 SG: Nine.

                 <br>                 GA: By nine situation, people, events, whatever, that have been very instrumental in transformations for her and breakthroughs. The snake represents regeneration and rebirth. These memories of our experiences or lessons, whatever they are, she has the ability to go through them and be transformed. The symbol of the snake. The dove is the symbol of wisdom, peace. Wisdom if the little bird is carrying an olive twig. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an olive twig here, so this is just peace and love. This thing in the background. One, two, three, four, five, it just represents all of the perceptions, mental, emotional, spiritual. And the key?

                 <br>                 SG: mmhmm

                 <br>                 GA: represents the key to knowledge, to the wisdom that you, through a teaching learning situation you can acquire. Then also bringing to earth, the two fingers. The orange color is the second chakra color, which is healing. It&#39;s the color of healing. Healing and renewal. There&#39;s also some red, which is a lot of energy, fashion. Isis is holding a bow in her hand, and it&#39;s the crescent moon. That&#39;s symbolizes the unconscious, the subconscious.

                 <br>                 SG: I had thought of the Hierophant as being a very disciplined, ordered card, at least from the Waite deck. That&#39;s what is represented in the social orders, social hierarchies. This reading is very different. That&#39;s good.

                 <br>                 SG: With Jane. Together?

                 <br>                 GA: Yeah. This is the pregnant lady in the deck. She is the princess of disks. She has gone, walked up the top of the mountain, gone through the briar patch. All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You&#39;re in the clear. You&#39;re out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you&#39;ve gone through. That the both of you have gone through. Again, the Aries, moving forward, the Aries horns, the ram horns, moving forward with awareness.

                 <br>                 There&#39;s a snake, and she&#39;s carrying it on her shoulders, and it looks like a cloak and it&#39;s asleep. She&#39;s near getting ready to do this transformation, to give birth to a new identity. Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn&#39;t been able to be with her, because you&#39;ve worked through all these things.

                 <br>                 The long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It&#39;s sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I&#39;m loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.

                 <br>                 The other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she&#39;s touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She&#39;s holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it&#39;s horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.&quot;

                 <br>                 SG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?

                 <br>                 GA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it&#39;s inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you&#39;ve got things in control. You&#39;ve got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It&#39;s the earth symbol. She&#39;s a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She&#39;s sort of like three-dimensional. I don&#39;t know.

                 <br>                 SG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What&#39;s the background Gloria?

                 <br>                 GA: Would you like some--?

                 <br>                 SG: Yes, I would love. What&#39;s the background? Is it mountains?

                 <br>                 GA: Yes, she&#39;s walked through the mountains. It&#39;s been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She&#39;s gone through the dark forest.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she&#39;s got there?

                 <br>                 GA: That&#39;s part of the snake.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a snake?

                 <br>                 GA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you&#39;re going to give birth to a project that&#39;s financially rewarding, or you&#39;re going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I&#39;m not sure.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s good. For sure it&#39;s not financial. [laughs] I don&#39;t see that at all. It must be the other.

                 <br>                 GA: Yes. She looks a little tired. It&#39;s been a long haul.

                 <br>                 GA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

There&#39;s a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called.
