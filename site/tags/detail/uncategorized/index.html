There are people who actually do that. Where am I at? Oh yes, you&#39;re around a square. Let me look at my notes on this for one second. One of the things that goes on with all the Eros connections, and in your case, I think it works mostly pretty well for you. It is all trines and it&#39;s like you can get a little lazy in this respect. Trines can make for a lot of laziness.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Yes, that&#39;s one of my qualities.

In your chart, it generally works fairly well. It&#39;s not like you mess yourself up with your Eros. You have absolutely no tolerance for boredom or for conservatism in the strict sense of the people who are interested in making it like they think it was three days ago. You&#39;re always moving forward, very inventive, with no respect for authority [chuckles] whatsoever, or convention, or--

                 <br>                 If somebody tells you you should do things because this is the way they are done, this is absolute useless information to you, and you&#39;re very likely to do exactly the opposite exactly for that reason. It&#39;s the sense of--

They figure it&#39;s good for everybody to have their ideas shaken up periodically, and you have that also, of the sense of always wanting to figure out the thing that no one has thought of, that&#39;s going to--People getting their set images of the world, or set ways of thinking or whatever, you&#39;re the person who&#39;s always looking for the little something that&#39;s going to shift the way everything looks, that&#39;s going to turn the world upside down. Not for yourself, but for other people also.

There&#39;s lots of ideas, lots of new ideas all the time and enthusiasm for everything, and there&#39;s this real quest for new stuff. Not just for newness in itself, which is a Gemini thing, just there&#39;s this sense of wanting to unhinge. It&#39;s an intellectual thing. Unhinge the way people are looking at the world, or the way that you&#39;re looking at the world.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I see.

A lot of people have a lot of problems with that. You&#39;re fairly comfortable with it, and there is--There&#39;s some counterbalancing thing with your Saturn and Gemini. There&#39;s a particular intellectual rigidity that you&#39;ve had to fight in yourself, but on some levels, you&#39;re very much looking for the thing that turns it all upside down. The one problem with the amount of strength is that you can be impatient, and impulsive, and need to channel those flashes sometimes, or that will to break it all up and start all over.

Because occasionally, you can get into trouble with that if you don&#39;t stick around long enough to find out what&#39;s useful in some particular way of looking at something. You&#39;re immediately wanting to shake it all off and start all over, which can be a problem. I would worry about it more if it was square. I think it works pretty well for you for the most part, but there is occasionally a need for moderation. It&#39;s also, it being this very electrical explosive-- Not explosive, it&#39;s not quite the word, but--

One of them is that real oceanic, Neptuneian, empathic connection, which is very non-intellectual in any of the traditional senses of intellectual. It&#39;s totally feeling a spiritual non--It&#39;s very little to do with your mind than any traditional-- Or it&#39;s totally right brain kind of mind, if anything. It&#39;s connected with the mind at all. It&#39;s all the right side. Uranus is more of a traditional intellectual kind of thing, but it doesn&#39;t work linearly at all. It&#39;s not that kind of thing, it&#39;s a flash. Those are two very different kinds of spiritual energy.

You should trust them, but there&#39;s also a thing of-- Well, I&#39;ll get to that when I get to your notes, of real education and grounding of some of your psychic stuff is really important. That&#39;s not a substitute for trusting the psychic stuff. It&#39;s like the two of them should go together, of that sort of training and education, and then just doing it. They work together very well. It&#39;s not like you should play them off each other. Either you know it or you have this insight into it. It&#39;s the two of them work together.

                 <br>                 It&#39;s like the Sun is the basic energy and it&#39;s like your ascending is almost like your style of expressing that, or your preferred style of expressing it. If you had your way, this is how you would go about expressing your Sun. It&#39;s not so much an internal part of your personality. It&#39;s much more your style. It has very much to do with action in the world.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I like that analogy of the bottle.

With you, it&#39;s not that different from the other elements in your chart. There&#39;s a particular fastness to it. There&#39;s also a real concern within quality of ethics or value systems having a lot to do with how you want to express yourself. That&#39;s some focus and what you want to be doing in the world. There&#39;s a real sense of tie everything that&#39;s going on into your belief system. You don&#39;t want things scattered all over the place.

                 <br>                 Your Saturn in the seventh. Saturn is always a heavy-- It&#39;s also the teacher. I think there&#39;s this really wonderful book on Saturn, by the way, if you want a really nice astrology book. Have you ever seen this book, which is called Saturn? It&#39;s by a woman named Liz Green.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Yes. I&#39;ve seen it. I should read that.

The thing we&#39;re talking about, this is a lot-- That&#39;s what Saturn is about a lot. It&#39;s teaching through restriction of-- It depends a lot on the aspects to it and whatever, but to some extent always Saturn is a lot about where the blockages are, where you hold back. Saturn is also about how you define yourself, in a way that to some extent is very necessary to survive in the world and to some extent becomes a limit, especially when you&#39;re starting to get into spiritual stuff. There&#39;s a lot of stuff of getting past Saturn and undoing your-- It&#39;s like Sun and Saturn are like two different facets of ego in a way. 

                 <br>                 Sun is the sense of the self-expressive. It&#39;s the [unintelligible 00:25:36] sort of expansive, the heart and all that of that sort of very ego-centric but in a generous kind of a way, of your rootedness in yourself and your sense of purpose and all that stuff. Saturn is your ego in the sense of how you define your limitations of, &quot;This is what I am,&quot; as opposed to something else. It&#39;s like you define yourself in a negative kind of a way, is Saturn, and it&#39;s a lot about structure and crystallization. It&#39;s like people have problems with Saturn have arthritis a lot and things like that. Just this real structure, rigidity thing.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Well, had a little bit of being in here, but it&#39;s gone now.

[laughs] It&#39;s like the other part of ego in a way of like, you define yourself by defining what you&#39;re not or where your restrictions are or whatever. It&#39;s blockages. Where you stopped yourself.

Saturn in the seventh is-- The thing of long term-- Well, traditionally it&#39;s marriage, but the sense of the perfect other or there&#39;s some real sense of really wanting the perfect other, or the person who is your compliment and is your lifelong companion or whatever. There&#39;s a real yearning for that and it doesn&#39;t come very easily at all.

                 <br>                 I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a lot of things. First of all, there&#39;s really wanting that and also being afraid of it. Usually, wherever you have Saturn, you can go in one of a couple different directions with it. It&#39;s all like, there&#39;s a blockage and you can scatter in one of two ways. You can either get into a thing of you&#39;re completely obsessed with the relationships or you get into a thing of you&#39;re fiercely independent and you don&#39;t need a relationship.

Because I remember I mentioned before, your Saturn was retrograde. When Saturn is retrograde, a lot of the structure-- That thing about structure and protecting yourself from the world and defining yourself in relationship to the world in terms of your limitations of some rigid idea of who you are or whatever. When you&#39;ve sat on retrograde, to some extent, you don&#39;t do that in the usual way. You don&#39;t set your limits, you don&#39;t put barriers around yourself in the way that most people do.

                 <br>                 It&#39;s another one of these things of you don&#39;t have a lot of psychic defenses. There&#39;s a sense of you take in stuff very easily. You don&#39;t have your little barricade against the world. If anything, the way it works, especially when you&#39;re younger, I think is you barricade yourself from your own self-conscious, but you don&#39;t barricade yourself from the world. It&#39;s like the defenses are internal. It&#39;s like it all gets turned inside of you, so that you are defending yourself against yourself as opposed to defending yourself against other people. I think it&#39;s probably particularly hard in childhood.

Oh, there&#39;s one particular kind of barrier that you don&#39;t have to get through that a lot of people have. On the other hand, it&#39;s caused you a certain amount of pain if you&#39;re not defended against the world in that way.

Just very at home in the world and grandiose and wonderful and all that stuff.

                 <br>                 It&#39;s interesting.

If you&#39;re ever going through stages in your life where, say, you&#39;re doing all intellectual stuff or all physical stuff or all out there in the world stuff without that internal, emotional-- What else can I say about Cancer? It&#39;s very much burrowing into yourself in this kind of way and making a home inside of yourself.

                 <br>                 Pluto in 8th house. The energy in both of those are similar. It&#39;s like the 8th house is the Pluto of the houses, kind of. It means that in some way there&#39;s a lot of emphasis in your life on transformation, a lot. There&#39;s a thing about Pluto where there&#39;s a constant need to transform yourself, move to another level. It&#39;s like the phoenix, is that symbol.

For example, let&#39;s say it&#39;s your left hand. What’s written on your left hand is the markings of your spirit, the things that your spirit needed to work out, the things that your spirit wanted to work out. It’s a marking of the progression you’ve made up until this point–your spirit has made up until this point. The markings on your right hand, or the hand that you use the most, is the marking–marks the progression that you’ve made in this life.

This hand is so weird &#39;cause, um-it shows--this shows a very strong will power. A very strong creation of one’s own destiny. Not like, if this line here were coming from this side here and coming up like mine does, this shows a life that is very much determined by other people. The whims of others or the desires of others–that sort of thing, But this shows a creative willpower–act of will which is carving out your destiny. And it also shows a destiny which is um….

This hand shows that you haven’t had an easy life when it comes to love. You’ve had some sort of traumas about love. But somehow these traumas have done several things.

A potential to be able to have a deep loving connection with another human being or with people in general, but it’s not quite actualized yet, it&#39;s like more of a potential. And it has to break from this romanticism stuff, because the romanticism stuff keeps you, will keep you distant from people. And this other line here shows another direction that you have in you to act out and it shows like the come up real high. See how it’s kinda comin up in there?

                 <br>         <strong>        GA:        </strong>         mmhmm

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         This coming in between these two fingers shows an ability to love in a complete way in a realistic way.

                 <br>         <strong>        CS:        </strong>         And I think a healthier kind of love. And see how it’s kind of coming in here but it&#39;s not quite actualized yet.

                 <br>                 Which does mean that you have a tendency to have trouble sticking with things over the long haul, sometimes.

You make connections with people very easily, and you&#39;ll do that. Then you have a fair amount of emphasis on mutable with the Virgo. You have the Venus in Virgo and your midheaven in Virgo and Sag rising. The mutable is distributive. It&#39;s wanting to make the connections between everything, whichever element it&#39;s in.

                 <br>                 While Sag, in particular, is a lot that way of making the connections between philosophical ideas.

                 <br>                 It&#39;s not like your 10 house is ruled by Capricorn.

Your moon is yourself also, but it&#39;s the less conscious, more emotional, reactive, emotional, less purposeful. The sun is like your sense of purpose.

Neptune is the real oceanic, at-one-with-the-world, complete loss of ego, that kind of spirituality. I mean it&#39;s ocean. That&#39;s all I can think of is ocean, and this real sense of being very much at one with everything and peaceful and also very prone to-- It&#39;s also a planet of illusion and just being lost in stuff and drugs. People who have screwed up Neptunes are way into drugs. When there&#39;s problems with your Neptune, there&#39;s a real problem dealing with reality, altogether.

You have a vision of how connected everything is and of how it should be that way and how everyone should be feeling that. The fact that the world as you have to live it day to day is so far from that is so horrible that there&#39;s a real tendency to just withdraw into yourself and build your own fantasy world, because there&#39;s this incredible--You have a sense of such empathy with all the stuff around you. There&#39;s all the violence or the whatever or the horrible stuff that&#39;s going on in the world. It&#39;s just too much to deal with alongside that feeling of connectedness with everything.

It&#39;s also because of your Saturn is retrograde, which is different, but it also has to do with not being very well defended against the world, psychically. Especially with sun conjunct Neptune. There really is this thing of a real strong, empathic connection with everything living around you.

This is the problem with people with strong Neptune things is you&#39;re so aware of everyone&#39;s pain or everyone&#39;s whatever that you can&#39;t deal with it. It&#39;s like having skin of parchment or something. You&#39;re feeling everything&#39;s pain and everybody&#39;s pain and everybody&#39;s whatever.

There&#39;s also, one of the things that people with that kind of stuff tend to do is withdraw into a real fantasy world. I have a moon in Pisces, a really strong moon in Pisces, which is similar stuff. It works in a different way than mine, because yours is much more connected with your sun, which means in some ways that you have a hard time getting a handle on who the hell you are.

                 <br>                 Especially when you were a kid, I imagine, had a really hard time figuring out who you were and what you wanted to do in the world and what your sense of purpose was or what your own value was, even, because, first of all, it was really difficult for you to separate out yourself from everything else around. There wasn&#39;t a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way.

We&#39;ll have to get together for dinner some night during that time. I would guess that it will be that Monday. I don&#39;t remember the date, should be-- My guess is that it&#39;ll be Monday, June 8th. I&#39;ll try to get in touch with you. If you don&#39;t hear from me, call the house or something so I can figure out where I can find you, or give me your office number, which I doubt I still have, and we&#39;ll work something out. Okay. Right now I am heading to a shopping center where I&#39;m going to look around for some interiors.

                 <br>                 If I don&#39;t find some interiors, I&#39;m also looking for a pair of nylon bathing trunks, swim trunks, whatever you call them. I had a pair I bought maybe 20 years ago, that I still have, but they&#39;re finally getting unglued. From my standpoint, if you can get 100% nylon swim trunks, they dry out so fast. It&#39;s always a pain in the neck when you go for a swim and you come out and that damn things stay wet for a couple of hours. These things, you could come out and you&#39;d be completely dry in 20 minutes. They wear like iron, which is great for sailing.

                 <br>                 I&#39;ve seen some in Sears, but the bastards never have any assortment. I see exactly the one I want in size small, which is hardly what I can use. I see lots of what I don&#39;t want in the size that I normally wear. Among my other things, including looking for interiors, I also check every Sears store I see to see if maybe they got the swim trunks I&#39;m looking for. Anyway, enough of this garbage. Talk to you in a couple of weeks. That&#39;s all. Bye-bye.

Whether there&#39;s a smooth connection between things, or they&#39;ll clash. 

                 <br>                 Gloria Anzaldúa: That&#39;s what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Right.

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : That&#39;s a lousy way to put it because it&#39;s not a matter of bad. There&#39;s  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. 

                 <br>                 Also, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it&#39;s probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. 

                 <br>                 Conjunction is neutral, although it&#39;s a very powerful aspect, it&#39;s not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don&#39;t like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I&#39;ve seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn&#39;t work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. 

                 <br>                 Things come so easy that it&#39;s hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you&#39;re not challenged. You don&#39;t run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it&#39;s like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy.

Anyway, that&#39;s basically-- There&#39;s also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way.

Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people&#39;s needs  sometimes.

There&#39;s something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They&#39;re different for the different aspects, and they&#39;re also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it&#39;s one of the  inner planets, it&#39;s one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It&#39;s too past Saturn and Mars as one. 

                 <br>                 This side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees.

Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.

                 <br>                 How that goes into your sun, is first of all, that&#39;s really connected to your sense of  self. There&#39;s two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world.

Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It&#39;s the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It&#39;s in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I&#39;ve done drugs. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, it&#39;s a drug thing. It&#39;s such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I think I do that too. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto&#39;s type spirituality is a very different- - It&#39;s much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It&#39;s more occult, it&#39;s more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It&#39;s  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff. Whereas Neptune is much more diffuse.         </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#ADFFD9" data-initial-bg-color="#ADFFD9" data-tags="Transcript"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#A3A3A3"> Uncategorized </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Transcript</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:09:30</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]"> <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Do you know if Scorpio is going to go into Scorpio in the next [crosstalk]?

You look historically at the different  Pluto transits, it&#39;s when Pluto was in Cancer, was the Depression. When Pluto was in  Leo was the discovery of atomic energy, and when it was in Virgo was drugs, all the  drug culture stuff. Lots of people getting into health stuff, all of a sudden.

The third planet  sun house-- Planet that&#39;s connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It&#39;s like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It&#39;s like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Wow. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it&#39;s  very disorienting, and it&#39;s very exciting. It&#39;s not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It&#39;s much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It&#39;s exciting, and  it&#39;s sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It&#39;s like when you&#39;re doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That&#39;s Uranus, obviously. 

                 <br>                 Uranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There&#39;s a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways.

It&#39;s a plus in  that it makes it easier for you to reach out beyond that. It makes it harder in that it&#39;s  sometimes very hard for you to get a handle on where you end, where other people  begin, and where your responsibility to other people ends. Also, in terms of psychic  stuff, it means that you need to consciously develop psychic protection because the  world rushes in when you align.

The moon interests me a lot. It&#39;s the strongest planet in my  chart, the sun and the moon. They&#39;re always strong in my chart. They&#39;re super strong  because it&#39;s sun in Leo which is always life and six planets of Leo and then there&#39;s  the moon in Pisces, single off in the planet. The moon really fascinates me in terms  of, I really think it has a whole lot to do with childhood and with patterns established  in childhood. A lot to do with survival mechanisms that get set up in childhood in  terms of how you learn to relate, how you learn to adapt yourself to the world  because it&#39;s very much about this half-conscious way of adapting to new stuff.

It&#39;s also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn&#39;t really get rolling until you&#39;re older. People  are much more like their moons when you&#39;re kids. 

You grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it&#39;s much more, you have no power and you&#39;re in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger.

These people really act on them. The queens and the princesses or defenders. The frontal people they face you, they defend. The knights and the princesses are hunters, the more aggressive kind.

She is ruled by Aries, and there&#39;s a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she&#39;s looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing.

They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She&#39;s wearing two bracelets.

There&#39;ll be a child that will trigger that in her, of owning her childlike innocence and playfulness.

                 <br>                 The child will represent Horace, like the father represented Osiris. Isis in this picture is a contemporary woman. The man was older, the child was younger. Isis is a contemporary woman and someone that&#39;s close to her age. This woman will open up vistas in the occult, in maybe tarot or the i ching, or maybe a reading that she had. Some psychic thing will be mirrored to her by a contemporary woman who&#39;s into the occult, or into the mysteries, or spirituality. When she recognizes that woman, then it&#39;s like recognizing her potential to get into the occult and her inner spirituality. Basically, this is the part of the family of Osiris, Isis, and Horace the baby. Isis is down here, holding a sword between her thighs. Isis is represented by the hierophant and Horace is the five-pointed star.

                 <br>                 SG: With Jane. Together?

                 <br>                 GA: Yeah. This is the pregnant lady in the deck. She is the princess of disks. She has gone, walked up the top of the mountain, gone through the briar patch. All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You&#39;re in the clear. You&#39;re out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you&#39;ve gone through. That the both of you have gone through. Again, the Aries, moving forward, the Aries horns, the ram horns, moving forward with awareness.

                 <br>                 There&#39;s a snake, and she&#39;s carrying it on her shoulders, and it looks like a cloak and it&#39;s asleep. She&#39;s near getting ready to do this transformation, to give birth to a new identity. Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn&#39;t been able to be with her, because you&#39;ve worked through all these things.

                 <br>                 The long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It&#39;s sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I&#39;m loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.

                 <br>                 The other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she&#39;s touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She&#39;s holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it&#39;s horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.&quot;

                 <br>                 SG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?

                 <br>                 GA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it&#39;s inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you&#39;ve got things in control. You&#39;ve got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It&#39;s the earth symbol. She&#39;s a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She&#39;s sort of like three-dimensional. I don&#39;t know.

                 <br>                 SG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What&#39;s the background Gloria?

                 <br>                 GA: Would you like some--?

                 <br>                 SG: Yes, I would love. What&#39;s the background? Is it mountains?

                 <br>                 GA: Yes, she&#39;s walked through the mountains. It&#39;s been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She&#39;s gone through the dark forest.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she&#39;s got there?

                 <br>                 GA: That&#39;s part of the snake.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a snake?

                 <br>                 GA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you&#39;re going to give birth to a project that&#39;s financially rewarding, or you&#39;re going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I&#39;m not sure.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s good. For sure it&#39;s not financial. [laughs] I don&#39;t see that at all. It must be the other.

                 <br>                 GA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called. To do this, you need to take into account your love nature, the Venus aspect that the way you relate to people and the way you-- Como se dice?
