It&#39;s a lineup of four of the outer  planets exactly in alignment at some point in the next few years, which is another  just-- Things like every time there&#39;s a lineup of any two of the major planets,  something really incredible happens. Every time that Jupiter and Pluto, I think, have  lined up, the president who has then been in office, has been killed in office. It&#39;s like,  oh, it&#39;s weird.

She&#39;s such a strange  combination. She&#39;s a lawyer, and very meticulous about her law. She&#39;s not the kind  of person who you would think would be into this stuff at all- [crosstalk] 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Into astrology. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: -but she&#39;s completely into it. We just sit around and talk about it, and  she&#39;s like, such an incredible thing to think that, yes, we know this is going to  happen. We know it&#39;s going to happen in the next four years and to try and imagine  how you can prepare for this is overwhelming, but I&#39;m sort of psyched. [laughter] I  think it&#39;ll be real interesting. Anyway, that&#39;s the generational stuff. The third planet  sun house-- Planet that&#39;s connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It&#39;s like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It&#39;s like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Wow. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it&#39;s  very disorienting, and it&#39;s very exciting. It&#39;s not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It&#39;s much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It&#39;s exciting, and  it&#39;s sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It&#39;s like when you&#39;re doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That&#39;s Uranus, obviously. 

 <br> Uranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There&#39;s a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways.

It&#39;s like this very internal thing. I&#39;m not even aware of it, but it&#39;s very much rooted in me, this Uranian energy. It&#39;s also conjunct my Venus. I would do things like solve a math problem in my head in about 10 seconds that if I was to sit down and try and figure out the answer to, it would take me four hours. I even did that with astrology a lot, of like, &quot;I&#39;ll figure something out.&quot; I&#39;ll have just an insight, a flash of, &quot;Oh, this is X,&quot; and I&#39;ll say that, and then I&#39;ll get panicked about it, because I have no excuse for that answer. Then I&#39;ll go back and I&#39;ll track that, and I&#39;ll come out with the same answer four hours later, but that&#39;s very fast, non-linear
intellectual stuff. Yes, it&#39;s [unintelligible 00:18:53].

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have that with people. Like I&#39;ll see people, and I&#39;ll put two and two together, but in a way that is not like addition, you know?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s interesting because lots of times, you&#39;ll see like one or the other of the outer planets, which are the ones that have to do with psychic stuff. With you, you&#39;ve got both-- Your Pluto isn&#39;t all that strong in the chart, but you have both the Neptune and the Uranus are very strong, very focal, important planets so that your psychic stuff is coming in two different-- There&#39;s two different major sources of it.

One of them is that real oceanic, Neptuneian, empathic connection, which is very non-intellectual in any of the traditional senses of intellectual. It&#39;s totally feeling a spiritual non--It&#39;s very little to do with your mind than any traditional-- Or it&#39;s totally right brain kind of mind, if anything. It&#39;s connected with the mind at all. It&#39;s all the right side. Uranus is more of a traditional intellectual kind of thing, but it doesn&#39;t work linearly at all. It&#39;s not that kind of thing, it&#39;s a flash. Those are two very different kinds of spiritual energy.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have this problem that I always want to verify these flashes. It slows them down. I should trust them.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Although for you, there&#39;s some value to that. You should trust them, but there&#39;s also a thing of-- Well, I&#39;ll get to that when I get to your notes, of real education and grounding of some of your psychic stuff is really important. That&#39;s not a substitute for trusting the psychic stuff. It&#39;s like the two of them should go together, of that sort of training and education, and then just doing it. They work together very well. It&#39;s not like you should play them off each other. Either you know it or you have this insight into it. It&#39;s the two of them work together. [unintelligible 00:21:01]

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see.

[unintelligible 00:03:06] I don&#39;t see you as much of a Virgo, either, although there&#39;s Virgo in your chart. Anyway. Also, you&#39;re very little fixed. It&#39;s mostly mutable, which is the Sag. Mutable or calm. There&#39;s two different ones. [unintelligible 00:03:29] that there&#39;s four different elements, then there&#39;s three different modes, they&#39;re called. There&#39;s cardinal, fixed and mutable. You&#39;re mostly cardinal and mutable. The only thing that&#39;s fixed in the entire chart is Pluto and Leo, and everybody born anywhere around us had Pluto and Leo. It&#39;s a generation thing, it&#39;s not very specific to you.

 <br> Which does mean that you have a tendency to have trouble sticking with things over the long haul, sometimes. On the other hand, it means that you don&#39;t tend to get real rigid around things. You have lots of initiative. The initiative is the cardinal, and that&#39;s the real-- The people who always start things off usually have a cardinal [unintelligible 00:04:20] within whatever element it falls in, its the beginning of that. It&#39;s sort of like the springtime of that particular element or the beginnings of figuring out what that stuff means. With you it&#39;s Ares, cardinal fire.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I&#39;ve got about six books that I&#39;m working on. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. They always have great ideas and tons of initiative and just go out there and they&#39;ll start anything, and they&#39;re very fearless, usually about going out there and doing it, but then they get bored.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s why I have [unintelligible 00:04:52] The novel, I started writing that in &#39;74, and I&#39;m still working on it. That&#39;s almost 10 years.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Libra has that also, sort of initiative. It&#39;s in a different sphere, it&#39;s much more in social stuff. You make connections with people very easily, and you&#39;ll do that. Then you have a fair amount of emphasis on mutable with the Virgo. You have the Venus in Virgo and your midheaven in Virgo and Sag rising. The mutable is distributive. It&#39;s wanting to make the connections between everything, whichever element it&#39;s in.

 <br> While Sag, in particular, is a lot that way of making the connections between philosophical ideas. It&#39;s a lot more communication and sort of putting the stuff out there in a way. The cardinal is the initiation and then the fixed is the consolidating whatever that particular element is. Then you get to the mutable, which is spreading it around in the world. You&#39;re big on starting it and spreading it around the world, and you have a little bit trouble of just sort of [unintelligible 00:06:19] [crosstalk]--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, let somebody else finish it.

this is  an old energy. That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, &quot;Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.&quot; What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it&#39;s just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.   <br> 

What this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn&#39;t just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It&#39;s saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, &quot;Yes, this is who I am. I&#39;m the power and what I want is right for everybody.&quot;   <br> 

Now where&#39;s Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it&#39;s in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.   <br> 

Having Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that&#39;s the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn&#39;t start off  saying, &quot;Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I&#39;m just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.&quot; It&#39;s saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.   <br> 

All right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you&#39;re breaking away is by seeing the truth that you&#39;re breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it&#39;s all illusions.   <br> 

It&#39;s not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It&#39;s telling you that you&#39;ve been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It&#39;s not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You&#39;ve already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don&#39;t have to see, &quot;Oh gee, what is power? I can&#39;t use it blah blah blah.&quot;   <br> 

In fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it&#39;s saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I&#39;m  not here.&quot; Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, &quot;Who me, Cherrié? Oh no, not me. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking  about. What power? I got no power.&quot;   <br> 

Yet at the same time, the people are there saying, &quot;Oh, Cherrié she doesn&#39;t have any  power.?&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;What do you mean I don&#39;t any? Hey, listen, I have all this power  and I got to use this power. Here I am.&quot; Then it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I do?&quot;  &quot;Oh, no. No, I was just kidding. Just kidding, folks. No, I don&#39;t have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.&quot; It goes back and forth. There are some days in  which you&#39;re right up there, you&#39;re right there looking straight into your destiny and  saying, &quot;Yes, this is who I am, and this is who I have to be.&quot; Other days you&#39;re just  looking at that and saying, &quot;Oh my God, I can&#39;t possibly accept this power. This is  just much too scary. It&#39;s much too much. No, I can&#39;t deal with it.&quot;   <br> 

It is this duality of saying, &quot;Yes, I want it. No, I don&#39;t. Yes, I&#39;ve got to have it. No, I  can&#39;t.&quot; What you&#39;re trying to do is to find the perfect balance, is to be able to be a  channel of that power, accept your power, but not feel that you have to take on too  much of the power and not feel that you can&#39;t accept yourself as you truly are. It&#39;s a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it&#39;s saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it. That&#39;s a really  important energy with the T.   <br> </p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8

It&#39;s like this very internal thing. I&#39;m not even aware of it, but it&#39;s very much rooted in me, this Uranian energy. It&#39;s also conjunct my Venus. I would do things like solve a math problem in my head in about 10 seconds that if I was to sit down and try and figure out the answer to, it would take me four hours. I even did that with astrology a lot, of like, &quot;I&#39;ll figure something out.&quot; I&#39;ll have just an insight, a flash of, &quot;Oh, this is X,&quot; and I&#39;ll say that, and then I&#39;ll get panicked about it, because I have no excuse for that answer. Then I&#39;ll go back and I&#39;ll track that, and I&#39;ll come out with the same answer four hours later, but that&#39;s very fast, non-linear
intellectual stuff. Yes, it&#39;s [unintelligible 00:18:53].

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have that with people. Like I&#39;ll see people, and I&#39;ll put two and two together, but in a way that is not like addition, you know?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s interesting because lots of times, you&#39;ll see like one or the other of the outer planets, which are the ones that have to do with psychic stuff. With you, you&#39;ve got both-- Your Pluto isn&#39;t all that strong in the chart, but you have both the Neptune and the Uranus are very strong, very focal, important planets so that your psychic stuff is coming in two different-- There&#39;s two different major sources of it.

One of them is that real oceanic, Neptuneian, empathic connection, which is very non-intellectual in any of the traditional senses of intellectual. It&#39;s totally feeling a spiritual non--It&#39;s very little to do with your mind than any traditional-- Or it&#39;s totally right brain kind of mind, if anything. It&#39;s connected with the mind at all. It&#39;s all the right side. Uranus is more of a traditional intellectual kind of thing, but it doesn&#39;t work linearly at all. It&#39;s not that kind of thing, it&#39;s a flash. Those are two very different kinds of spiritual energy.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have this problem that I always want to verify these flashes. It slows them down. I should trust them.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Although for you, there&#39;s some value to that. You should trust them, but there&#39;s also a thing of-- Well, I&#39;ll get to that when I get to your notes, of real education and grounding of some of your psychic stuff is really important. That&#39;s not a substitute for trusting the psychic stuff. It&#39;s like the two of them should go together, of that sort of training and education, and then just doing it.

What that means is that when you  were born Cherrié, at the moment of your birth there happened to have been the  planet situated themselves in such a way that they actually formed these big shapes  in the middle of the sky. To have one is not super unusual but it&#39;s not that common  either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they&#39;re very important  because they tend to color everything else in the chart. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\nYou have both a T-square and a Yod, and the T-square is caused because you have  two planets that were 180 degrees away from each other, so they formed this  straight line, the red line. Then you had another planet that was 90 degrees from the  other two, so it forms two right angles or a T shape in the middle of the sky. The T square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit  together. However, X can be anything, Cherrié. That X could be a relationship, it  could be money, it could be material object, it could be work, it could be the perfect  body. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt could be the perfect mind, it could be anything and X can change. You can decide  oh, oh, this is really X on Tuesday and then maybe by Thursday, you can say well I  thought about it again and I realized that&#39;s not really X, this is X instead. If you do  decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it,  for a while it really does make you feel complete. After a while it really gives you the  feeling of just like gee, this isn&#39;t quite right, it isn&#39;t quite working. You really feel oh I  have to go off and I have to find something else to fulfill me. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s really analogous to going around and looking for wall outlets. You find an outlet,  and you plug your plug into it and the energy starts flowing through and you feel  really great and then all of a sudden you short out. Of course, the most normal thing  to do in that point is to pull your plug out of the outlet and to say, \&quot;Oh what a stupid  outlet, it isn&#39;t working, I got to go find another outlet.\&quot; What the T-square is saying is  that you do have the short circuit inside of you. Now the short circuit is caused  because you have an imbalance of energy. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nNow you&#39;re not doomed to the short circuit. It&#39;s not saying to you, \&quot;Oh, well, tough  luck, Cherrié, for the rest of your life you&#39;re going to be like this.\&quot; It&#39;s saying no, okay  there is an imbalance and you can write the imbalance. Now what the imbalance is  depends upon the particular planets in the T-square. Now in your case, you have a  special kind of T-square, because it doesn&#39;t just involve planets. It also involves  these two points which are called the nodes. Now the nodes, are not really planets at  all. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIf you take the orbit of the earth around the sun, and then you take the orbit of the  earth&#39;s moon around the earth, those orbits cross in two places. The intersection that  faces north is the north node, and it points up, and it represents breaking away from  past life karma. The intersection that faces down is the self node, and it represents  getting sucked into past life karma. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;CM&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: Great.\n&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;_uncategorized_&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Transcript&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrology and Spirituality&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Personal Development and Identity&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Past Lives&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrology and Spirituality&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrological Aspect&quot;]}]]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;40882cac-1650-4bf5-b25c-739665235f28&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Default&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;b4d01f88-255a-4b38-87bc-c22de97464da&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;7c5f30be-4b4c-4555-bc9e-2572ffeaa82f&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,352],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,687],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Amy&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: To have a T-square with the nodes first of all Cherrié it&#39;s telling you that this is  an old energy. That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, \&quot;Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.\&quot; What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it&#39;s just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nWhat this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn&#39;t just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It&#39;s saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, \&quot;Yes, this is who I am. I&#39;m the power and what I want is right for everybody.\&quot;  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nNow where&#39;s Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it&#39;s in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nHaving Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that&#39;s the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn&#39;t start off  saying, \&quot;Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I&#39;m just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.\&quot; It&#39;s saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nAll right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you&#39;re breaking away is by seeing the truth that you&#39;re breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it&#39;s all illusions.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It&#39;s telling you that you&#39;ve been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It&#39;s not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You&#39;ve already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don&#39;t have to see, \&quot;Oh gee, what is power? I can&#39;t use it blah blah blah.\&quot;  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIn fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it&#39;s saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it&#39;s like, \&quot;Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I&#39;m  not here.\&quot; Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, \&quot;Who me, Cherrié?

Just kidding, folks. No, I don&#39;t have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.\&quot; It goes back and forth.

It&#39;s a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it&#39;s saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it.

You&#39;re just too  messed up. You&#39;ll really misuse it. You can&#39;t touch it.\&quot; The reason why it does that is  from your dark side&#39;s point of view, you&#39;re in this really terrible position because first  of all, it had power.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt really had it, and you used it, and your dark side loved it because it had all this  incredible energy.

You went through a number of very painful  lifetimes, and your dark side lost its power. Now, here you are in this situation where  there&#39;s this power hanging right in front of you, and it&#39;s saying to you, \&quot;Cherrié, use it.\&quot;  You&#39;re there going, \&quot;All right.

You can&#39;t even breathe on it.\&quot; Your dark side&#39;s freaking out saying,  \&quot;Well, if I can&#39;t have it, she can&#39;t either.\&quot; It&#39;s energy, instead of trying to co-opt the  power, it knows enough now that it can&#39;t possibly co-opt the power. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nYou are in no way an evil person, and you&#39;re not going to be an evil person.

If I keep her  from being transformed, I&#39;m going to not be transformed either.\&quot; It&#39;s always in there  creating all these illusions about the power, saying to you, \&quot;Don&#39;t touch it.

Right. Well, see, I&#39;m not being selfish.  I&#39;m not being messed up. I have to go deal with this person, or this situation, or this  community, or whatever it is.\&quot; It&#39;s telling you that you have to be really careful about  the illusions that your negative energy creates under the guise of positive energy.  The way you can tell is how it feels, because no matter what it sounds intellectually,  no matter how much you say to yourself, \&quot;Oh Gee, really, it&#39;s got to be like this. It&#39;s  really got to be this way. It sounds really good in my mind. It&#39;s really creating it.\&quot; If it  in your heart, you just don&#39;t feel good about it, you&#39;re just saying, \&quot;I&#39;ve got do this. I&#39;ve  got to.\&quot; Then you know, you&#39;ve got to go with what your heart says.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nWhat your negative energy does is it creates all this mental veneer, it keeps pulling  things up in your mind and saying, \&quot;Cherrié, what about this? Oh, and how can you  think you&#39;re ready? Isn&#39;t that ego?\&quot; Then you think, \&quot;Oh, [unintelligible 00:15:44], it  must be ego. I can&#39;t think I&#39;m ready, so I&#39;m not ready.\&quot; Whereas it&#39;s all that energy  saying, pull her back. Pull her back. Don&#39;t let her go. Don&#39;t let her go.\&quot; That&#39;s why  really accepting your destiny is really confronting that intellectualization of that power  as well. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;_uncategorized_&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Transcript&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Personal Development and Identity&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Identity&quot;]}]]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;40882cac-1650-4bf5-b25c-739665235f28&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Default&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;b4d01f88-255a-4b38-87bc-c22de97464da&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;ece3b672-38f1-4d44-a7da-0c377490506e&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,961],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,1158],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Amy&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: Now every T-square has a point where it needs to balance because it is a T.

You have to clothe yourself in the truth. You have to hold the sword of truth and you have to communicate it. You have to be it.\&quot; There&#39;s a  lot of parts of you that are in there saying, \&quot;No, I don&#39;t want to look at this destiny  because it hurts. Besides it&#39;s scary.

I&#39;ve really got to get out there and deal with the energy.\&quot; The other side of it  is it says that you&#39;ve got to really use that power that for many lifetimes you&#39;ve been  sitting on it and really saying, \&quot;I&#39;m not ready, I&#39;m not ready. I can&#39;t use it. I&#39;ll just blow  it again. I&#39;ll blow it again.\&quot; This lifetime, you&#39;re right there. It&#39;s like your divine energy  has come right down to you and it&#39;s saying to you, \&quot;Okay, Cherrie, this is the time.  This is it. You really have to use the energy.

Now, the fact that the Scorpio is in the void does not mean that you  don&#39;t connect to Scorpios. As a matter of fact, what it says is that at times Scorpios  can be incredible catalysts to your life. Because it&#39;s almost like their energy,  especially if their sun or any planet that they have fits into the void. It&#39;s saying that  then that energy really helps you to realize the T-square energy. Of course, Barbara  is a Scorpio. I don&#39;t know if her son, I can&#39;t remember what the degree of her son is,  so I don&#39;t know if it fits into this or not.

A Yod is called a Yod because actually Yod is the Hebrew letter for Y, and it is a  Y shape. You&#39;ve got two sets of planets that are 60 degrees away from each other.  They form a 60-degree angle, then both of them are 150 degrees away from the  stem point.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s interesting that the stem point here is also Jupiter. Jupiter is the stem for both the  T Square and the Yod. What this says is that you have to be really careful at pushing  yourself too hard. It&#39;s like you&#39;ve wanted to get through this karma so badly that  you&#39;ve almost decided in past lives that you were just going to burn straight through  it. You had at least in one lifetime, I know of at least one in which you were just, ugh. You just decided, lay it on me Lord. It was just like, \&quot;Okay, I am just going to totally  burn through this. I am not going to get stuck in this again.\&quot; You did have, I don&#39;t  know if it was your last lifetime or the lifetime for it but it was incredibly painful. It was  very much involved in this intense victimization experience. Your death was a particularly incredibly horrible death where you died.

It was so traumatic for your soul. Yet, see, the thing that was so  intense about it is that in this really weird way, you engineered it because it was  almost like you said, \&quot;Okay, that&#39;s it. Okay, maybe I victimized some people. Well,  I&#39;m just going to burn right through it. I&#39;m just going to rip it off my soul because I&#39;m  not going to deal with this anymore.\&quot; See, I feel like your misuse of power was  probably a number of lifetimes ago and you started off dealing with it more  intellectually, and you got very frustrated where you felt like, I have to get back to  using this power. I can&#39;t stand being impotent and not being able to use the power. \n\nWhat you decided to do was to just sear it right off of you and you had this life. It was  weird because it&#39;s almost like you didn&#39;t have to go through it. It&#39;s like you just got  this thing in your head that you had to release the energy and it&#39;s like you couldn&#39;t  realize that the way you had to release it was to forgive yourself. It was you couldn&#39;t  forgive yourself. You were so tied into this idea that somehow you were really evil,  that you couldn&#39;t just say, \&quot;Hey, look, just forgive yourself. Let it go.\&quot; \n\nIt was almost like in that lifetime, things just kept happening to you that were  incredible. It was almost like one of those catastrophic lifetimes where you just could  think, what next? How could something else happen to this woman? Yet you would  just keep walking right into it. It was like, this isn&#39;t hard enough. This isn&#39;t heavy  enough. I&#39;m not going to be convinced that I&#39;m released until I hit something really  heavy. \n\nFinally, when you went into that death, it was about the heaviest thing that could  possibly happen to you. It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing?

It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ve got to be feeling at  this time. The other thing that goes along with that is just the realization that you  really need to follow your hunches. You just get hunches about everything, and  they&#39;re really gut-level. Lots of times you don&#39;t follow them because you are scared,  because you think, who am I to have these kinds of hunches?

You have what&#39;s known as a  soulmate or a karmic mate. This is a person that you have been involved with in past  lives in many different ways. You may have been her lover, you may have been even  enemies, or parent and child, or teacher and student, or siblings, or colleagues, or all  kinds of things, and in this lifetime, you come together with the potential to be one  with each other on all levels, mentally, physically, psychically, sexually, emotionally,  spiritually, every single level you can think of, you have the ability to be one with this  person.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nHowever, there is no way to tell if someone is your soulmate by what sign she is, by  what the person looks like, by what they do, by when you meet this person. There is  no way to tell by any external means. The only way to tell when a person is your  soulmate is by the fulfillment of different indications. There are also ways to tell  because this relationship is not a lot of things. It is definitely not in any way, shape,  or form an abusive relationship. It cannot possibly be an abusive relationship. It is  also not in any way, shape, or form a relationship that does not allow you to be your  true self. This person has got to totally support you in your true destiny, just as you  must support her in her true destiny. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; \n\nNow one of the indications is the fact that you find you cannot separate from this  person, literally, physically. No matter how much you try to be apart, there is some  greater force than yourself bringing you together so that you find that you can meet  this person and maybe at first you don&#39;t feel a big thing. Maybe you meet this person  at a party or a bar or a conference or a meeting or something like that and you might  feel like, \&quot;Oh.\&quot; Somehow you&#39;re going to keep connecting to this person. It&#39;s like,  \&quot;Look, Cherie, this is the person. This is it,\&quot; which is why you can never meet the  person and then do nothing and then someday wake up when you&#39;re 85 and in the middle of the night and say  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;CM&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: She is the one.

You get  chance after chance after chance, which is why even if you&#39;re together and you feel  like, \&quot;Oh, fuck, I don&#39;t want to deal with this.\&quot; Forget it. You find that you&#39;ve got to be  there. You&#39;ve got to work it out together. The second qualification is the fact that you are willing to put more into this relationship than any other relationship you have ever  experienced. This relationship forces you to go beyond your own ego and your own  sense of self and it&#39;s mutual. You are both working out this relationship energy, so  it&#39;s not like you can&#39;t do it. It&#39;s like you are forced to deal with it. You are forced to do it. You find that in spite of yourself, your head might be going, \&quot;No way, Cherie, why  should you work it out? Forget it. You are not going to work it out,\&quot; and your heart is  saying, \&quot;You get in there and you work it out. You are not about to not work it out.\&quot;  You find that you cannot help but work out the relationship.

The third qualification is the fact that the relationship itself follows a  certain pattern. First, there&#39;ll be a plateau and everything will be very nice and very  easy and very lovely. Little by little, it builds up to some kind of crisis point. Now it  might be your crisis, it might be the other person&#39;s crisis, it might be internal, it might  be external, but it&#39;s some kind of crisis point. You find that the more you&#39;re able to  work out the crisis point, the more able you are to love each other, to be together, to  experience oneness with each other. Then it goes to another plateau until it builds up  to another crisis point. The amount of time between the crisis points depends upon  the couple.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nFor some couples, it&#39;s every two minutes, and for other couples, it&#39;s every five years.  It just depends on what it is that you&#39;re working out. The fourth qualification is the fact  that you find it&#39;s really difficult to explain why you love this person. You can&#39;t explain  it. It goes beyond explanation. Cause you feel like, \&quot;I love her because she&#39;s so-- No, that&#39;s  not it. It must be because she&#39;s-- No, that&#39;s not it. I think it&#39;s because of-- No, that&#39;s  not it.\&quot; You find that you just cannot possibly explain it. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s so deep. It feels  so intense inside of yourself. You cannot explain it in any way, shape, or form. It&#39;s a  really deep energy. All you can do is really trust that energy and know that this is  exactly the right energy for you. &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;_uncategorized_&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Transcript&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrology and Spirituality&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrological Aspect&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrological and Tarot Symbols&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Venus&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrological and Tarot Symbols&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Neptune&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrology and Spirituality&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Karma&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Personal Development and Identity&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Relationships&quot;]}]]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;40882cac-1650-4bf5-b25c-739665235f28&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Default&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;b4d01f88-255a-4b38-87bc-c22de97464da&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;d72dab1f-0039-4843-bfa6-520e46811d44&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,2819],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,3083],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Amy&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: What the soulmate indication does is it guarantees that you will meet this person.  What you do after that its up to you. It doesn&#39;t say, \&quot;Oh, and you&#39;ll live happily ever  after.\&quot; You still have to work out the relationship. Obviously, for you, it&#39;s a very  intense energy because you do have a real struggle opening up your heart.  Obviously, this person is definitely going to open up your heart, and she is not going  to allow you to close down. The other thing is that it&#39;s really forcing you to let go of  pain around relationship. It&#39;s forcing you to work out sexuality, and it&#39;s forcing you to  open up to the truth inside of yourself. It&#39;s forcing you to say, \&quot;Yes, this is who I really  have to be. I can not be anybody else.\&quot;  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nNow the other thing it says is that with the Saturn conjuncture Neptune that in this  lifetime, you really have to use your healing energy in your work. Of course, you can  only do that when you experience love in your heart, and that you really have to experience a deep openness and a deep energy inside of yourself, and that you just  have to know that this is the truth, that you have really got to experience the truth  inside of yourself. You&#39;ve really got to experience the knowledge that you are a  healer in this lifetime and that you&#39;re really meant to use the love that you&#39;re feeling  from other people to learn to love yourself, to learn to forgive yourself.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nThe key here is self-forgiveness, it is self-acceptance, and it&#39;s the knowledge that all  you can do is really, really be open to this truth. All you can do is really, really be  open to what you know is true inside of yourself. Now Saturn, Neptune, and Venus  are sextile the moon and Mars. This is interesting because then Venus is sextile the  Mars, which is the union of the so-called male-female energy. It does say that when  they work together, you feel a real sense of completeness and openness inside of  yourself.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nThen these are both in conjunct to Jupiter, which says that at times you feel a real  duality between that really active part of you, the real so-called male aggressive,  active, powerful part of you, and then the real victimization part of you so that what  you&#39;re trying to do is to switch energy. You&#39;re trying to get the male energy part of  you to experience nurturing, to experience love, to experience hope, to experience  transformation. You&#39;re trying to get the female part of you to stop being the victim  because that female part of you still really identifies with the victim. You need to get  her to feel strong, to feel strength to power, aggression, all the things that you want  to feel. You&#39;re switching the energy.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nThat&#39;s what the Yod is talking about is the real switch of energy will allow you to  release yourself from that duality because it says at times, you really experience that  duality, and it is very confusing to you. Here you are, one day, you can be so strong  and so aggressive and totally like, \&quot;No, I do not experience this pain inside of  myself.\&quot; Then the next day, you can just totally fold in on yourself and experience  real victimization.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s very confusing to you because you feel like, \&quot;What is going on?\&quot; Of course, then  too, you&#39;re giving real mixed messages to people. Both I&#39;m invincible, I am strong,  and I&#39;m the complete victim. Then you&#39;re feeling like, \&quot;What the hell? What kind of  credibility do I have that I&#39;m expressing both of these energies?\&quot; Yet they&#39;re both  there because they&#39;re both a part of you. What you&#39;re trying to do is to give power to  the victim and give compassion and love to the assertive part of you so that both of  them experience a synthesis and a connection inside of yourself, and that&#39;s a really  strong work that you&#39;re experiencing at this time.

The reason why this is coming up so strongly now is that you are starting about a six-year cycle. That is a very important cycle for you. It&#39;s like you started it  actually years ago. You started it about four years ago. You started this very important Saturn experience, and then you had a respite. You had a rest for about a  year, and now you&#39;re starting it again.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nFirst Saturn in the sky as you know is continually moving. You happen to have all  this stuff back to back. As you can see, you have so many planets right here. Now  what happened is that you have Saturn, it passed over your 10th house. The 10th  house is the house of work, and Saturn rules work.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nWhen Saturn passes through the 10th house, it says then that you really are  experiencing a real need to deal with your work energy. That was happening, I think  it was around &#39;78. Let me just check. It started at 11 degrees of Leo. You started  experiencing it starting in September of &#39;76, actually. You started experiencing it. It  continued until September of &#39;79. That was over a three-year period. Then you had a  little bit of a respite. Then starting last September, so September of 1980, you  started experiencing it again very intensely, and you will continue experiencing it for  quite a while.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;CM&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: Now, is that specifically around work again, or this is something [crosstalk]?  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Amy&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: No, now it&#39;s something else. Okay? Now what you&#39;re experiencing is a number  of things because first of all, you have your sun in Libra. You also have Saturn in  Libra, and you have your ascendant in Libra. I know you have your ascendant in  Scorpio, excuse me, but your 12th house is ruled by Libra. Whenever Saturn passes  over the sun or Saturn or the 12th house, it creates a very deep experience. Now  your sun is in the same sign as your Saturn and your Saturn is in your 12th house.  It&#39;s like having three different cycles all back to back, all affecting you all at the same  time. That&#39;s a very intense energy for you. [crosstalk]  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;CM&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: It started in September?  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\n&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Amy&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;: It started in September. Now what it does is it affects you on all these different  level. First of all, it affects you with your sun. What it says is that you are then having  to confront all of your own limitations at this time, and you really have to deal with all  the limitations that you create inside of yourself. Also, you&#39;re in your Saturn return, and the Saturn cycle affects you in a lot of different ways.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nFirst of all, one of the ways it affects you is that it really forces you to really let go of your childhood and to accept your adult energy so that all of a sudden, you, Cherrie,  are learning to be an adult in a total way. Now what that means is that you&#39;re  empowering yourself. You&#39;re really accepting your power and your identity on a  whole new level, on a level that you have never experienced before. It&#39;s saying then that you really need to deal with a lot of different issues with your Saturn cycle.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nThe first issue is the issue of letting go of your childhood, which means that all of a  sudden, all these things that you have really associated with your childhood. All the  things that you haven&#39;t felt ready to deal with, you really have to deal with now. It&#39;s really connecting and confronting that energy. Really being able to look at it, really  being able to say, \&quot;Yes, this is something that I really have to deal with. This is  something that I really have to connect to. This is something that I really have to  confront inside of myself.\&quot; Now the second thing that&#39;s going on with this is the  realization that you also then have to deal with your work.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nOne of the ways that we decide whether a person is an adult or not is by their work,  which is why obviously for so long women were never considered adults. [chuckles]  You are really looking at your work now and deciding what you&#39;re going to do with it. You&#39;ve got three choices. Either what work you&#39;ve been doing so far isn&#39;t your true  work, and now that you&#39;re in your Saturn cycle, you have to let go of it, and you have  to accept your true work, or you&#39;ve just been doing something that was really right for  you, and it was your true work, but now it&#39;s changing, and you&#39;re accepting a new  energy because you&#39;re now going to another level, or what you&#39;ve been doing has  been your true work, but now you&#39;re really broadening it and extending it and  experiencing it on a whole new level.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s saying that it&#39;s very, very, very important for you to really get in touch with  experiencing that transformational energy and knowing that now is a time for you to  let go of your past and to really accept your future. You do this in a number of ways.  First of all, the first step in the Saturn cycle is figuring out what you really don&#39;t want.  It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re in there cleaning out your psychic closets and you&#39;re saying,  \&quot;Okay, well, I don&#39;t need this anymore and I don&#39;t need this anymore and I don&#39;t need  this anymore. I really don&#39;t need to let go of this energy. I don&#39;t need to hold onto this  energy. I can let go of it. I am going to let go of it, and I&#39;m really going to accept a  new energy deep inside of myself.\&quot;  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nThe next step is figuring out what you really do want. That&#39;s harder because it comes  in dribs and drabs. It&#39;s learning how to be quiet enough and open enough to accept  that energy. It&#39;s learning how to say, \&quot;Oh, okay, I&#39;ve really got to learn how to accept  this energy. I&#39;ve really got to be open to accepting this truth inside of myself and  knowing that this is exactly the right energy for myself.\&quot;  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nIt&#39;s slowly and surely getting in touch with the energy and learning how to be open to  that energy in a really good way. Now the third thing that happens with the Saturn  cycle is because the etheric body of adulthood, consciousness of adulthood is  actually connecting to your real physical body. You&#39;re really changing your  connection to other people who used to be adults to you. Your connection to your  parents can change because they&#39;re no longer your parents. It&#39;s like you are now an  adult. You are peers now.&quot;]}]]]}]]],&quot;tags&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;_uncategorized_&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Transcript&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrological and Tarot Symbols&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Saturn&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrological and Tarot Symbols&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Zodiac&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Personal Development and Identity&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Upbringing&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Personal Development and Identity&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Family&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Personal Development and Identity&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Identity&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;category&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrology and Spirituality&quot;],&quot;tag&quot;:[0,&quot;Astrological Transit&quot;]}]]],&quot;set&quot;:[0,&quot;40882cac-1650-4bf5-b25c-739665235f28&quot;],&quot;setName&quot;:[0,&quot;Default&quot;],&quot;file&quot;:[0,&quot;b4d01f88-255a-4b38-87bc-c22de97464da&quot;]}],[0,{&quot;uuid&quot;:[0,&quot;f95f5f95-173c-4a7c-9763-dd4c376d73e7&quot;],&quot;start_time&quot;:[0,3346],&quot;end_time&quot;:[0,3804],&quot;annotation&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;10th House: Placements in the 10th House refer to notions of life purpose, success, and social acknowledgement.

All of a sudden, now, you&#39;re really confronting that mortality, and you&#39;re  grieving for the loss of your childhood. It&#39;s really easy in your Saturn cycle to  experience a great deal of grief, and you&#39;ve just got to let it come right through you.  Also, you&#39;re grieving for the death of your parents no matter what shape your parents  are in.

It&#39;s that feeling of like, \&quot;Oh, everything&#39;s changing. I&#39;m in a  kaleidoscope now. I want everything to be the same.

Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it&#39;s in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion.

I&#39;m just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.\&quot; It&#39;s saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.  &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;line-break&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;\n\nAll right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy.
