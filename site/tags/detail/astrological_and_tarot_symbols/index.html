The recordings, most of which were recorded on audiocassette by Anzaldua herself, were made between 1980 and 1984 and document the writer‚Äôs interest in occult spiritual practices as methods of learning and knowing, what would inform a sense of what Anzaldua refers to as Spiritual Activism.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; The early 1980s are a critical period in the study of Anzaldua‚Äôs life and work, with the 1981 publication of the landmark Feminist anthology, &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;This Bridge Called My Back,&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; which was co-edited by Gloria Anzaldua and Cherri√© Moraga and published by Kitchen Table Press.

Evidenced in these recordings are not only Anzaldua‚Äôs interest in what we might readily identify as ‚ÄúNew Age‚Äù spiritual practice, such as tarot, palmistry, and astrology, but the networks of spiritual practitioners, scholars, and activists that Anzaldua interacted with while living and writing in the cultural hotbeds of San Francisco and later, New York.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; Audiovisual materials provide unique insights into history. Through the voices and conversations captured in this collection of recordings, listeners may come closer to understanding the particular ways in which histories were first embodied in their own present time. Laughter, silence, pauses and hesitations, the crunching sounds of mixed nuts, creaking doors, and detours in conversation: these artifacts within artifacts carry meaning that can only be interpreted in real time, while also revealing the imperfections and spontaneity of the historical process. This exhibit serves to index recurring themes within the collection, while also pointing to related areas and artifacts of the broader Anzaldua Papers, including manuscripts, subject files, and other audiovisual materials.&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;&quot;]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;Description of the Recordings&quot;],&quot;bold&quot;:[0,true]}]]]}],[0,{&quot;type&quot;:[0,&quot;paragraph&quot;],&quot;children&quot;:[1,[[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;There are over 300 audiocassette tapes in Anzaldua‚Äôs collection. Described in the Benson‚Äôs finding aid as ‚ÄúSpirituality Recordings,‚Äù these 16 audio recordings document palm readings, astrology readings, and tarot readings and workshops. Many of the recordings prominently feature Anzaldua as she receives readings; other figures that appear in the recordings include Cherrie Moraga, Chela Sandoval, Angeles Arrien, and Sally Gearhart. The earliest recordings in this exhibit were made in the late Summer of 1980 and document a series of tarot workshops taught by Angeles Arrien, a cultural anthropologist and author of ten books including &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The Tarot Handbook : Practical Applications of Ancient Visual Symbols&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (1987), and &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;The Four-Fold Way: Walking the Paths of the Warrior, Healer, Teacher and Visionary&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (1993). These classes were attended by Anzaldua, showing a deep interest in the Tarot. Anzaldua demonstrates her knowledge by giving a tarot reading in 1981 to Sally Gearhart , an activist , novelist, professor active in San Francisco, and co-author of &quot;]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot;A Feminist Tarot&quot;],&quot;italic&quot;:[0,true]}],[0,{&quot;text&quot;:[0,&quot; (1981), along with Susan Rennie. In many of the recordings, Anzaldua receives either palm, astrology, or tarot readings.

I don&#39;t know exactly where it&#39;s found, maybe it was two and a half. I&#39;m not sure. We&#39;d have to look at maybe the transits. I  mean, the exact-- I mean the memories, to look back to actually where the  [unintelligible 00:00:14] but [unintelligible 00:00:15] and it probably would&#39;ve  gone back and forth in turns, because Saturn always goes back and forth, but  Saturn, in terms of being a planet-- the 10th house is Saturn&#39;s natural house anyway.

 <br> When Saturn transitioned midheaven, it&#39;s a really big deal and has a lot to do with either you get serious about your work then, or you lose it. It&#39;s like your big  opportunity to get it together, in terms of being real disciplined about your work.

 <br> Depending on what&#39;s been going on with Saturn and you, and how much you&#39;ve  gotten your work together.

That&#39;s what I was saying. It feels like being premenstrual, sort of. You can almost figure out what&#39;s-- it&#39;s like almost there. Stuff is rumbling around in the background. It&#39;s imminent, this feeling of imminence and of something that is happening and you don&#39;t have very much control over and you can&#39;t really quite figure out.

 <br> It could be good in terms of writing and could be real interesting to just maybe to try and actually focus on using imagery or relying more on imagery that comes from a real subconscious source for a while and playing around with that because there&#39;s a lot of stuff going on on that  level, at the moment, and a lot of flashes.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: And a sense of the responsibility in terms of what you&#39;re kind of feeling. It just feels a little more weighty than it does usually.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, and it&#39;s a real interesting time for a lot of people. It depends a lot on how Saturn is placed in the chart.

Your Saturn return happens somewhere between when you&#39;re 27 and  30.

 <br> It&#39;s interesting because you look at all kinds of people&#39;s lives. You notice  all these people. Even hippies turn into businessmen, and, you know, people would  be-- Whatever.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: And businessmen turn into hippies.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: This is when people also have decided that &quot;No, this is not really what  they want to do.&quot; They want to do something else. It&#39;s a real re-evaluation time.  There&#39;s some people, the people who have been real disciplined, real strong about really getting it together about what they want to do with themselves. It&#39;s usually a real rewarding kind of time. It depends, but a lot people go through a lot of changes. There&#39;s a much more figuring out what your priorities are in your life. That&#39;s somewhere around 28 years old, 29 years old.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It seems that I have to do that every few years. [crosstalk] Basically, I  know, overall--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A lot of Scorpio, a lot of 8th house or a heavy Pluto. Any of those three. You need to go through transformations pretty regularly or the energy degenerates.

I love doing that. I have whole notebooks where I collect things, but getting past that
stage--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The trick is to move from that to the Sagittarian‚Äì[unintelligible] To develop to the 9th house thing which is the-- Geminis are collecting all the little pieces, and Sagittarius is the big picture, when you put it all together and you make it into a system or a vision.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s great. That&#39;s a good image.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The pitfalls of the two, Gemini can&#39;t see the forest for the trees and Sagittarians can&#39;t see the trees for the forest. It&#39;s fun-- Intellectual styles, it&#39;s 3rd house, 9th house, Gemini and Sag are real different. You can have huge arguments about it, too.

The other stuff comes naturally, but putting the little pieces together, I have to work at it. I&#39;m usually go through a trauma right after I finish gathering everything and then I know I have to start processing it and putting it together. I have writer&#39;s block. I go through this trauma every single time, even if it&#39;s just a poem. Usually I need to just go with the process and sit and not do anything about it for a couple of weeks, and then slowly of itself it&#39;ll-- When I try and force it it&#39;s very traumatic.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That&#39;s interesting, because I work the other way around. I get the big picture first, and then I have to go back and actually fill it in and make it so that it really is comprehensible and makes sense and back up what I&#39;m saying. That&#39;s were I get all--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: See, I start off by having the big picture, an idea, [unintelligible 00:11:39] the vision and then I gather all this little data, but to glue it together, that&#39;s where the trauma comes.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The other thing about this South Node, North Node things is that South Node is in Pisces and North Node is in Virgo. Some of the ways that intellectual stuff comes to you is in terms of-- It&#39;s Piscean, it&#39;s psychic and very fluid and spacey and a little mystical and all that, and the stuff that&#39;s harder and that you have to work for more is the much more disciplined-

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Detailed.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: -focused, detail-oriented.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: S√≠. Exactly. Wow, do you know me.

 <br> [laughter]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Virgo in the 6th house are real interesting, especially being a Leo. I used to always have problems relating to that stuff, at all. The more I think about it, it&#39;s the hermit card in Tarot or the virgin, not in the sense of Virgin Mary, but the ancient virgins who were the temple priestesses.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sufficient unto themselves.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, that it was important in the chart, because as far as I knew there was just that--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it&#39;s interesting, because usually unless there&#39;s certain aspects or placement or something unusual going on with that planet, it&#39;s not a very important planet in people&#39;s charts, unless they&#39;d doing a lot of spiritual disciplines, which is different. If people are heading into spiritual stuff then the outer planets are more involved, because they have to do with that. Otherwise people who are living normal, everyday sorts of lives, usually those planets are not very important. They&#39;re much more important by generation. On your chart I wonder where the aspects of [unintelligible 00:17:50] There&#39;s the [unintelligible 00:17:53] Mars, there&#39;s the sextile, there&#39;s that little triangle, there&#39;s conjunct.

It&#39;s important mostly by aspect, all those aspects. These two trines and that sextile. They&#39;re all numerous aspects, too. Has it got any squares? Yes, and it is square your nodes. The only aspects you count to the node are squares.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: So Uranus square nodes?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Squares, conjunctions and oppositions, those are the only ones that count. It&#39;s not considered a bad or difficult aspect when it&#39;s square to the nodes, usually. I don&#39;t know. People argue back and forth about that. Some people do consider it difficult. Some people would read a square from this to the nodes as being a little bit out of sync with the times in either direction, either being a little bit ahead of the times or a little bit-- Probably ahead if it&#39;s Uranus, Uranus is always ahead, but being a little bit ahead of your world so that there&#39;s always-- It makes it difficult and exciting at the same time, because it tends for people to think you&#39;re a little off the walls sometimes.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yeah. The body. It has lots to do with health and stuff, in general, the 6th house. It&#39;s [unintelligible 00:21:51] the body as temple.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I think what that means is that it just went direct. What happens is that when the planets switch from retrograde to direct or direct to retrograde, there&#39;s a period in which they slow down markedly, and then they go again. There&#39;s like a shifting of the gears and they slow down a lot. Different people make different things about it being more-- I don&#39;t even know what to do with it, but I know that there&#39;s something about--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It came up right when on the shift point or after the shift. That&#39;s funny, because I talk a lot about this shift in perspective in my essay.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s interesting. That&#39;s Uranus kind of stuff. Uranus is like-- it&#39;s like a kaleidoscope. You turn the kaleidoscope and the whole thing changes. That&#39;s Uranus kind of stuff. All of a sudden something happens, and the way the world looks to you is suddenly completely rearranged, all the pieces are in different places, and your perspective on something changes very fast and very radically. It&#39;s very Uranian.

 <br> It&#39;s going to be really interesting when it goes [unintelligible 00:28:54] I think it&#39;ll be a nice point, too. The Neptune stuff you can probably do without-- You can&#39;t do without it. It&#39;s there and you should deal with it. It&#39;s probably good for you, but it&#39;s not easy. The Uranus stuff, I think, will be fun. Traumatic in moments, but it&#39;s--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Isn&#39;t it happening now, though?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s there. I don&#39;t know exactly where.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: What does this--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s somewhere in Sag. No, that&#39;s Uranus. Neptune. When was this done?

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: This was done last May.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: You don&#39;t think it&#39;s happening now?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it is happening now. It&#39;s just that it started then.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s going to stay there for a little while?

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yeah, and I was able to do all those pages of writing.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, your moon is in Aries. It&#39;s an interesting time for you when it&#39;s in Aries. You&#39;d be writing from a much less conscious, &quot;This is what I&#39;m going to do now,&quot; and a much more rush of energy that you&#39;re not quite sure where it&#39;s coming from.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, that&#39;s when I have a hard time. It&#39;s like everything is so big.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Actually, it went into Aries on New Year&#39;s-- Just before New Year&#39;s it went into Aries, which is odd.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Well, then that&#39;s when I was having a hard time. Yes, that&#39;s when I was having a hard time.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I noticed that Capricorn is hard.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Cancer, not as much, because at some point in the later part of Cancer it transits with Jupiter, which is nice. The early part of Cancer is a drag, because it squares your sun and with Mars.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s very interesting because, see, I had kept up with the houses and the planets, but I hadn&#39;t kept up with the moon and the houses. That&#39;s really interesting.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it&#39;s interesting. [unintelligible 00:34:13] It makes a big difference. People of suns in Cancer or moons in Cancer or a lot of stuff in Cancer or in some other way have a very strong moon feel the moon cycles much more than other people. A lot depends on your char. Depending on what planets are pronounced in your chart to start off with, different transits will hit you stronger than they would other people. I feel the moon transits pretty strongly because [unintelligible 00:34:43] I feel the sun transits real strongly. You would feel Jupiter transits a lot and Venus transits a lot.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Like my friend Randy has his moon in the 10th house, and he&#39;s always very keenly aware of the moon.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: What sign is it in?

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Moon in Virgo.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A strong [unintelligible 00:35:20]. Yes. I have a friend with a moon in Cancer, and we sat down, we were working with her chart once and-- No, she&#39;s got sun in Cancer, moon in Virgo. We figured out, and it was real interesting, it helped her a lot. We figured out that-- I sat down and started telling her which moons would be difficult for her and which moons wouldn&#39;t, and she was like, &quot;I go through this every month.&quot; It was like, once she got used to the idea that that was happening, it was like the times-- there were three signs in a row that were all real difficult for her, and every month she would go through a week that was just the pits.

 <br> Once she got used to the fact that, yes, okay, that&#39;s happening and it&#39;s going to pass in three days, it was much more manageable to her because she would just be incredibly depressed, and it would drag on. It wasn&#39;t just even a two and a half day one. It was seven, eight days in a row it would be rough for her, and once she got used to the idea that, yes, that was going to happen, it was more manageable.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Your moon is not that heavy duty in your chart. There are some moons that are more difficult for you than others, and they&#39;re not sequential. They&#39;re not one right after the other.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s good. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, you have a rough time with Capricorn. Capricorn&#39;s probably the worst. Capricorn, early Cancer. Capricorn, especially early Capricorn. The early part of Aries. Those are the lousy ones.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;ve been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It&#39;s  been a lot of work. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Even just physically, of saying, &quot;Okay I&#39;ve done enough for today,&quot; and  stopping, so you&#39;re not wiped out for the next week, but it&#39;s also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It&#39;s not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it&#39;s not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There&#39;s something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They&#39;re different for the different aspects, and they&#39;re also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it&#39;s one of the  inner planets, it&#39;s one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It&#39;s too past Saturn and Mars as one. 

 <br> This side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it&#39;s with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it&#39;s inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don&#39;t know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.

 <br> How that goes into your sun, is first of all, that&#39;s really connected to your sense of  self. There&#39;s two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it&#39;s generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Well, I better start developing. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it&#39;s there. When you&#39;re looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it&#39;s different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It&#39;s the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It&#39;s in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;ve done drugs. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it&#39;s a drug thing. It&#39;s such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I think I do that too. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto&#39;s type spirituality is a very different- - It&#39;s much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It&#39;s more occult, it&#39;s more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It&#39;s  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff. Whereas Neptune is much more diffuse.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#B3B3E6" data-initial-bg-color="#B3B3E6" data-tags="Zodiac"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Zodiac</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:09:30</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>GA</strong>: Do you know if Scorpio is going to go into Scorpio in the next [crosstalk]? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, and it&#39;s a very heavy astrological thing. It takes Pluto, I can&#39;t  remember calculus. It spends approximately 20 years in this sign, and so it affects  whole generations, and it&#39;s very interesting stuff. You look historically at the different  Pluto transits, it&#39;s when Pluto was in Cancer, was the Depression. When Pluto was in  Leo was the discovery of atomic energy, and when it was in Virgo was drugs, all the  drug culture stuff. Lots of people getting into health stuff, all of a sudden. It sounds like an incredible transformation of consciousness in some way in relation to that  particular area. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s going to be-- 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Libra is like feminism and relationship stuff. Feminism. When it goes  into Scorpio, it&#39;s supposed to be the apocalypse, basically. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yes. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It gets very intense. 1984, actually, Orwell was into astrology, and he  picked that date. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see. I talk about this in my essay a little bit.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It goes into 1984. It should be very heavy. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It stays until the year 2000. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. The world&#39;s shortest transit, which is interesting because there&#39;s  one line about the apocalypse in the Bible. About, unless these times be short, all is  lost, or something like that. It&#39;s the shortest transit up until now. It&#39;s in Scorpio.  Anyway, yes, it&#39;s very heavy.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, there&#39;s a thing going on. I can&#39;t remember exactly when it happens.  It&#39;s the lineup. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s in Scorpio or in Sag. It&#39;s a lineup of four of the outer  planets exactly in alignment at some point in the next few years, which is another  just-- Things like every time there&#39;s a lineup of any two of the major planets,  something really incredible happens. Every time that Jupiter and Pluto, I think, have  lined up, the president who has then been in office, has been killed in office. It&#39;s like,  oh, it&#39;s weird. When the outer planets line up, it&#39;s intense. Four of them, that never  happens. [unintelligible 00:12:05] 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s happening in &#39;82, I think, but I don&#39;t know which ones. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I remember somebody once was trying to explain this stuff to me. They  told me that things were supposed to get heavy in &#39;80, much heavier in &#39;82, and shit  hits the fan in &#39;84. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh. [chuckles] 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s like we&#39;re going to live through it. It&#39;s [unintelligible 00:12:27] very  rough timing. The other side of that is the Aquarian Age and also Pluto going into  Sagittarius, which will be a transformation in terms of philosophy, politics, and grand  belief systems. A new age.

She&#39;s such a strange  combination. She&#39;s a lawyer, and very meticulous about her law. She&#39;s not the kind  of person who you would think would be into this stuff at all- [crosstalk] 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Into astrology. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: -but she&#39;s completely into it. We just sit around and talk about it, and  she&#39;s like, such an incredible thing to think that, yes, we know this is going to  happen. We know it&#39;s going to happen in the next four years and to try and imagine  how you can prepare for this is overwhelming, but I&#39;m sort of psyched. [laughter] I  think it&#39;ll be real interesting. Anyway, that&#39;s the generational stuff. The third planet  sun house-- Planet that&#39;s connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It&#39;s like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It&#39;s like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Wow. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it&#39;s  very disorienting, and it&#39;s very exciting. It&#39;s not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It&#39;s much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It&#39;s exciting, and  it&#39;s sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It&#39;s like when you&#39;re doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That&#39;s Uranus, obviously. 

 <br> Uranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There&#39;s a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Right. It&#39;s also like relationship stuff and figuring out relationship stuff is  an incredibly profound thing for you. It&#39;s like wherever Saturn falls is an area that is in  some way restricted, does not come easy. It&#39;s like the lessons that you have to learn.  There&#39;s a lot about what you have to learn, what you have to work out. Assuming  that you do when you get it together, you are richer and more wise in that area than  anyone else is, but it&#39;s a struggle anyway, so let me know. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Does the point of fortune have anything to do with the fact that it&#39;s in the  same house as Saturn?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not a conjunct. It would make a difference if it was conjunct. There&#39;s no conjunct.

Your Saturn is a retrograde. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A retrograde Saturn. One of the things that means is that, in some  ways, you don&#39;t have a real strong sense of boundaries. This is where I end. Real sense of, this is who I am in the world, and this is where I&#39;m going. It&#39;s self-limitation  in a way that gives you strength. In a way, it&#39;s both a plus and a minus. It&#39;s a plus in  that it makes it easier for you to reach out beyond that. It makes it harder in that it&#39;s  sometimes very hard for you to get a handle on where you end, where other people  begin, and where your responsibility to other people ends. Also, in terms of psychic  stuff, it means that you need to consciously develop psychic protection because the  world rushes in when you align. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It does.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: You don&#39;t have that automatic stopping point with it, and you can get a  little overwhelmed because you don&#39;t filter it out. Everything just comes in and hits  you so fast. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Mirtha&#39;s the same way. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. Which is good in terms of the way you seem to be setting up your  life now, when you spend a lot of time alone and you do your work. It&#39;s like the  perfect way to deal with that kind of way. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: [chuckles] It&#39;s taken me all my lifetime. It&#39;s taken me all these years. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s like perfect. You have to make your own space, find your own path,  and guard it in some ways. You got to cherish it to the point where you don&#39;t let the  whole world flood in on you, overwhelm you all the time. It&#39;s particularly psychic,  other people&#39;s psychic energies that are overloading their circles.

Anyway, [unintelligible 00:23:24] 10 pounds, having all that stuff is that it&#39;s a lot of  ambition. Not in the sense of wanting to be rich and famous but in the sense of  wanting to make an effect on the world. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yes, I&#39;ve always felt very strongly. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Something else like not an important part of your life, that&#39;s real  important to you. It&#39;s much more important to you than it is to a lot of people. It&#39;s a  sense of, you will not be happy with yourself to just sit or lay back and let things  happen to you. Some sense of wanting to make a difference. We wanted to make a  real effect on some community of some sort. 

 <br> It&#39;s interesting because all the clients that fall in there and is the sun which is a sense  of yourself and what you want to be doing in the world. There is Neptune, there is  Venus, and there is Mars. Neptune is like aesthetics and love of beauty and harmony  and all that. Neptune is the psychic stuff and Mars is just like physical energy. It  seems my immediate take on that is the stuff that you-- It kind of affect you and your  make on the world is real positive.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, yes. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not manipulative, wanting to be a hard shift kind of thing. It&#39;s much  more wanting-- You know, you feel what&#39;s inside of you and you want to put that out  there, it&#39;s more like wanting to give something to the world as opposed to wanting the  world to do something to you. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: You know that [unintelligible 00:25:17] comes up from you a lot is the  gentle penetration of the wind which is-- It&#39;s not like making a big splash, it&#39;s just a  steady gradual, continuous effect.

Okay, Mercury in 11th house is-- Mercury is  certainly the way that you-- Let&#39;s say you process informations [unintelligible  00:27:45], you think how almost everyone has their own particular grid that you take  the [unintelligible 00:27:53] instrument that you express yourself out there to.  That&#39;s like your Mercury. Just even on how you put information together. It&#39;s  interesting because if you need to do chart comparisons. People who have Mercury  square to each other have a really hard time communicating [unintelligible  00:28:14]. It&#39;s interesting. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Really?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, I want to have that with my lover actually. It&#39;s very funny, we&#39;ll try.  Just even talking intellectually about stuff. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: We misunderstand each other, we&#39;re going for hours arguing, and when  you get to the end. We realize that we completely misunderstood what the other  person has said. We&#39;ll be arguing politics and when we get to the end of the  conversation we realize we were saying the same thing from the beginning. That  kind of miscommunication happens a lot when a Mercury is [unintelligible  00:28:43]. People who have Mercury that are conjunct or tied to each other have a  really easy time.

The way that  you think and the way that you put ideas together has an aesthetic tinge to it  altogether.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: This is how you draw the [unintelligible 00:32:48] squares on this  [unintelligible 00:32:50]. One thing that immediately strikes me in terms of this  particular opposition is there&#39;s a tension between all the stuff or the Mercury stuff I  was just talking about in your moon and areas, which is very impulsive, emotional  stuff. You feel something and you feel it now and you tend to say it right out there  and just act very fast. That is sometimes a little bit at war with your [crosstalk] the  lever, which is very into harmony and your sense of beauty and harmony and  balance and all that stuff. Is a little bit at war with the emotional nature, which jumps  right into everything. 

 <br> This is what I think right now, and this is what&#39;s true right now, and who cares if it  balances out anything and this is, whatever. There&#39;s little tension between those two.  Also, that sometimes your immediate emotional reactions to things can cloud your  intellectual clarity. You sometimes have to wait a little bit until the smoke clears  before you can really get clear on what you think about anything [inaudible  00:34:44]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The whole book is about Saturn. It&#39;s very, very good. I had a copy, I  should [unintelligible 00:41:15] copy. It&#39;s a terrific book.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s also a really nice little book called-- It&#39;s weird because it&#39;s in two  sections, and one of the sections, it&#39;s just boring and terrible and glocky. The other  section is really nice. I think it&#39;s just called The Four Elements, and it&#39;s by Steven  O&#39;Reilly. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I think I&#39;ve seen them.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s got one of the nicest descriptions of the elements I&#39;ve ever seen. A  really nice little thing on the planets too. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I might even have that. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s real basic, but it&#39;s one of the best basic books I own. I go back to it  all the time, it&#39;s wonderful. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have a lot of Dane Rudhyar. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I like some of his stuff, but I don&#39;t like others. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Well, sometimes he gets a little carried away with his theory and  philosophy. Very abstract in some ways. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s like, &quot;Yo, what does this mean about anybody?&quot; It&#39;s much more like,  he gets so off in the cosmic thing, it gets very hard to get any sense of what this  could possibly mean in somebody&#39;s life.

It&#39;s very much you look at the chart in terms of the things, the potentials you have to work with, and the  stuff that you&#39;re supposed to be doing this time around. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh, I see. 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A lot of people go into a real heavy karmic thing with that in terms of you  choose your chart, which I&#39;m [unintelligible 00:44:05] about because the politics of  that can get decidedly weird. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I always wondered, I have two here. Well, actually, there&#39;s one here if  you don&#39;t count that. One, and two there, four there, one here, and one here, and  one here. You don&#39;t count the nodes, right? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: We don&#39;t count them as the nodes. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: So that the heavy ones are the eighth house, the tenth house? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The seventh, any place you&#39;re sounding false is going to be a little  heavy. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Would this be heavier than that, then? 

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it is. The most intense house in your chart is your tenth house  without a doubt. That&#39;s all right. That&#39;s also a good one. That&#39;s the only one that I&#39;m  not just drawing into.

You need to get one for the year of your birth or get one that--They have like 10-year ones. Anyway, go to [unintelligible] and find out what you can find. If you can get one just for that year it would be nice but it might be hard.

 <br> <strong>Gloria Anzald√∫a</strong>: The year of my birth?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. The year of your birth will do it. Because on that method of progression during the course of your whole lifetime, you won&#39;t get much past Capricorn. Your Sun won&#39;t progress past here. There are different sorts of methods of progression. I don&#39;t work with progressions all that much altogether but that&#39;s the most standard one. Your moon would be-- Let&#39;s see, your moon in 43 would be circled down once and 28. Then 12, 12 days would be about-- I don&#39;t know if I can figure this out on my head, probably in Libra.

 <br> Yes, Libra maybe is working. I need to look it up. Almost maybe somewhere around there, would&#39;ve circled around all the way around once and then be a little less than halfway through, et cetera.

Your moon in the air is-- Wait a second, my air is over here and once would be about here.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It&#39;s because it&#39;s static. If we had things that we could turn around--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I know. People do charts like that sometimes where they have different pointers around. They do it for progressions that they have three different pieces of paper that are circles and there&#39;s one of your natal charts and then the transits and your progressions. They&#39;re moving them around and then they&#39;ll move it a little bit longer to see where you&#39;re going to be a year from now in relation to this and that and it&#39;s interesting. There are people who actually do that. Where am I at? Oh yes, you&#39;re around a square. Let me look at my notes on this for one second. One of the things that goes on with all the Eros connections, and in your case, I think it works mostly pretty well for you. It is all trines and it&#39;s like you can get a little lazy in this respect. Trines can make for a lot of laziness.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, that&#39;s one of my qualities.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I&#39;m not sure I have that luxury. [laughter] I&#39;m not all square. If you get lazy, you just stay in the same place. In your chart, it generally works fairly well. It&#39;s not like you mess yourself up with your Eros. You have absolutely no tolerance for boredom or for conservatism in the strict sense of the people who are interested in making it like they think it was three days ago. You&#39;re always moving forward, very inventive, with no respect for authority [chuckles] whatsoever, or convention, or--

 <br> If somebody tells you you should do things because this is the way they are done, this is absolute useless information to you, and you&#39;re very likely to do exactly the opposite exactly for that reason. It&#39;s the sense of--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Reacting?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Not in a bad way necessarily, but if you wanted to break through whatever structures are around you, you don&#39;t have any use for that, for social convention, in that sense. It really doesn&#39;t.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: In friendships too. I like to shake them up.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Oh, yes, it&#39;s a real shake-them-up energy. Aquarians are like this in general because they&#39;re ruled by that planet, but Aquarians always have this thing, they love to say things that are going to make everybody&#39;s jaw drop. They figure it&#39;s good for everybody to have their ideas shaken up periodically, and you have that also, of the sense of always wanting to figure out the thing that no one has thought of, that&#39;s going to--People getting their set images of the world, or set ways of thinking or whatever, you&#39;re the person who&#39;s always looking for the little something that&#39;s going to shift the way everything looks, that&#39;s going to turn the world upside down. Not for yourself, but for other people also. That&#39;s one of the services you perform for your friends; shaking up their worldview periodically, which is nice.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#B3B3E6" data-initial-bg-color="#B3B3E6" data-tags="Zodiac,Saturn"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Zodiac</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Saturn</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:11:19</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>GA</strong>: Sometimes they don&#39;t like this. [laughter]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Right, it could be a problem with Tauruses in particular, watch out for that. There&#39;s lots of ideas, lots of new ideas all the time and enthusiasm for everything, and there&#39;s this real quest for new stuff. Not just for newness in itself, which is a Gemini thing, just there&#39;s this sense of wanting to unhinge. It&#39;s an intellectual thing. Unhinge the way people are looking at the world, or the way that you&#39;re looking at the world.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s nice because you&#39;re really, in some sense, very comfortable with that energy. A lot of people have a lot of problems with that. You&#39;re fairly comfortable with it, and there is--There&#39;s some counterbalancing thing with your Saturn and Gemini. There&#39;s a particular intellectual rigidity that you&#39;ve had to fight in yourself, but on some levels, you&#39;re very much looking for the thing that turns it all upside down. The one problem with the amount of strength is that you can be impatient, and impulsive, and need to channel those flashes sometimes, or that will to break it all up and start all over.

Because occasionally, you can get into trouble with that if you don&#39;t stick around long enough to find out what&#39;s useful in some particular way of looking at something. You&#39;re immediately wanting to shake it all off and start all over, which can be a problem. I would worry about it more if it was square. I think it works pretty well for you for the most part, but there is occasionally a need for moderation. It&#39;s also, it being this very electrical explosive-- Not explosive, it&#39;s not quite the word, but--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Intense?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Very intense, but fast, intense. It&#39;s like flashes. Lightning or electricity is the best image I can think of.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I love lightning. Always [unintelligible 00:13:29].

Oh, you can short circuit periodically. That&#39;s all. It&#39;s another one of those stress yourself out of line, but it&#39;s really good that you&#39;re doing stuff like meditation or whatever, because there is this-- It can make you high strung after a while if you thrive on that explosive intellectual stuff to the point where you can burn. You can get yourself very frazzled if you&#39;re forever looking for the new thing to shake it all up, and you can just get real tired doing it.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I was an insomniac for a long time.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That&#39;s perfect. Yes, because Uranus transits, one of the major signs of Uranus transits is insomnia, when people are having real transits--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Wow.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I didn&#39;t even know this, when I had my chart done, I was having some strange Uranus transits at the time, and she said-- I had not said a word to her, but she said, &quot;Having trouble sleeping lately?&quot; She blew my mind.

The tenth house is not so much service to the world, it&#39;s wanting to give something to the world like in a more grandiose sense. It&#39;s the building of structures in some way.

We&#39;ll say Sun in the sixth house is the person who can handle the nine-to-five job a lot better. You&#39;ve got Uranus in the sixth house. It&#39;s a strong planet, so there is this real sense of wanting to do service, but your way of doing it is always going to be eccentric, and it&#39;s not going to be a regular, everyday whatever. It&#39;s going to be a much more impulsive visionary. Your brand of service is Uranian. You want to offer your visions to the world. That&#39;s your service. You&#39;ll never be able to deal with a kind of job that&#39;s too routine at all. You just can&#39;t cope with it. It&#39;s terrible.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: No, it kills me. It kills me.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: You shouldn&#39;t make yourself try. You should never do it unless it&#39;s like that or starving to death because it&#39;s terrible for you.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The Gemini and Uranus itself is a pretty intellectual planet. It&#39;s not linear thought, but it&#39;s intellectual. It&#39;s the flash of whatever.

I would do things like solve a math problem in my head in about 10 seconds that if I was to sit down and try and figure out the answer to, it would take me four hours. I even did that with astrology a lot, of like, &quot;I&#39;ll figure something out.&quot; I&#39;ll have just an insight, a flash of, &quot;Oh, this is X,&quot; and I&#39;ll say that, and then I&#39;ll get panicked about it, because I have no excuse for that answer.

intellectual stuff. Yes, it&#39;s [unintelligible 00:18:53].

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have that with people. Like I&#39;ll see people, and I&#39;ll put two and two together, but in a way that is not like addition, you know?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s interesting because lots of times, you&#39;ll see like one or the other of the outer planets, which are the ones that have to do with psychic stuff. With you, you&#39;ve got both-- Your Pluto isn&#39;t all that strong in the chart, but you have both the Neptune and the Uranus are very strong, very focal, important planets so that your psychic stuff is coming in two different-- There&#39;s two different major sources of it.

One of them is that real oceanic, Neptuneian, empathic connection, which is very non-intellectual in any of the traditional senses of intellectual. It&#39;s totally feeling a spiritual non--It&#39;s very little to do with your mind than any traditional-- Or it&#39;s totally right brain kind of mind, if anything. It&#39;s connected with the mind at all. It&#39;s all the right side. Uranus is more of a traditional intellectual kind of thing, but it doesn&#39;t work linearly at all. It&#39;s not that kind of thing, it&#39;s a flash. Those are two very different kinds of spiritual energy.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have this problem that I always want to verify these flashes. It slows them down. I should trust them.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Although for you, there&#39;s some value to that. You should trust them, but there&#39;s also a thing of-- Well, I&#39;ll get to that when I get to your notes, of real education and grounding of some of your psychic stuff is really important. That&#39;s not a substitute for trusting the psychic stuff. It&#39;s like the two of them should go together, of that sort of training and education, and then just doing it. They work together very well. It&#39;s not like you should play them off each other. Either you know it or you have this insight into it. It&#39;s the two of them work together.

I don&#39;t even know [unintelligible 00:21:35] it&#39;s some more of your quickness than your-- It&#39;s more visionary stuff in a particular way. It&#39;s like your ascendant-- Somebody described to me once I thought was nice, if you think of your Sun [unintelligible 00:21:55] move to some extent, but especially your Sun as being the contents of a bottle, that ascending is the neck and its particular channeling of your Sun.

 <br> It&#39;s like the Sun is the basic energy and it&#39;s like your ascending is almost like your style of expressing that, or your preferred style of expressing it. If you had your way, this is how you would go about expressing your Sun. It&#39;s not so much an internal part of your personality. It&#39;s much more your style. It has very much to do with action in the world.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I like that analogy of the bottle.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: I think it works. See, it&#39;s not all that much different for the rest of your chart if you&#39;ve got a lot of fire, air, and stuff. Anyway, in Meg it&#39;s very obvious because the rest of her-- She&#39;s a Capricorn, and a lot of the playfulness that would never be there usually in a Capricorn is the [unintelligible 00:22:51]. With you, it&#39;s not that different from the other elements in your chart. There&#39;s a particular fastness to it. There&#39;s also a real concern within quality of ethics or value systems having a lot to do with how you want to express yourself. That&#39;s some focus and what you want to be doing in the world. There&#39;s a real sense of tie everything that&#39;s going on into your belief system. You don&#39;t want things scattered all over the place.

 <br> Your Saturn in the seventh. Saturn is always a heavy-- It&#39;s also the teacher. I think there&#39;s this really wonderful book on Saturn, by the way, if you want a really nice astrology book. Have you ever seen this book, which is called Saturn? It&#39;s by a woman named Liz Green.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes. I&#39;ve seen it. I should read that.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s excellent. It&#39;s really excellent. Anyway, Saturn is the teacher and it&#39;s like a lot teaching through pain. The thing we&#39;re talking about, this is a lot-- That&#39;s what Saturn is about a lot. It&#39;s teaching through restriction of-- It depends a lot on the aspects to it and whatever, but to some extent always Saturn is a lot about where the blockages are, where you hold back. Saturn is also about how you define yourself, in a way that to some extent is very necessary to survive in the world and to some extent becomes a limit, especially when you&#39;re starting to get into spiritual stuff. There&#39;s a lot of stuff of getting past Saturn and undoing your-- It&#39;s like Sun and Saturn are like two different facets of ego in a way. 

 <br> Sun is the sense of the self-expressive. It&#39;s the [unintelligible 00:25:36] sort of expansive, the heart and all that of that sort of very ego-centric but in a generous kind of a way, of your rootedness in yourself and your sense of purpose and all that stuff. Saturn is your ego in the sense of how you define your limitations of, &quot;This is what I am,&quot; as opposed to something else. It&#39;s like you define yourself in a negative kind of a way, is Saturn, and it&#39;s a lot about structure and crystallization. It&#39;s like people have problems with Saturn have arthritis a lot and things like that. Just this real structure, rigidity thing.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Well, had a little bit of being in here, but it&#39;s gone now.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Good. Unless you&#39;re working with your Saturn [unintelligible 00:26:20]. [laughs] It&#39;s like the other part of ego in a way of like, you define yourself by defining what you&#39;re not or where your restrictions are or whatever. It&#39;s blockages. Where you stopped yourself.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s a real sense. It&#39;s a place of a lot of learning because in some way, wherever Saturn is, this is something that doesn&#39;t come easy. Therefore you have a tremendous opportunity to learn about, but it&#39;s very hard. Saturn in the seventh is-- The thing of long term-- Well, traditionally it&#39;s marriage, but the sense of the perfect other or there&#39;s some real sense of really wanting the perfect other, or the person who is your compliment and is your lifelong companion or whatever. There&#39;s a real yearning for that and it doesn&#39;t come very easily at all.

 <br> I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s a lot of things. First of all, there&#39;s really wanting that and also being afraid of it. Usually, wherever you have Saturn, you can go in one of a couple different directions with it. It&#39;s all like, there&#39;s a blockage and you can scatter in one of two ways. You can either get into a thing of you&#39;re completely obsessed with the relationships or you get into a thing of you&#39;re fiercely independent and you don&#39;t need a relationship.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I do both. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s a real thing of being incredibly aware of your own need for a relationship and vulnerability and feeling like you&#39;re incredibly needy or all this stuff. On the other hand, there&#39;s this real thing about total self-sufficiency.

Because I remember I mentioned before, your Saturn was retrograde. When Saturn is retrograde, a lot of the structure-- That thing about structure and protecting yourself from the world and defining yourself in relationship to the world in terms of your limitations of some rigid idea of who you are or whatever. When you&#39;ve sat on retrograde, to some extent, you don&#39;t do that in the usual way. You don&#39;t set your limits, you don&#39;t put barriers around yourself in the way that most people do.

 <br> It&#39;s another one of these things of you don&#39;t have a lot of psychic defenses. There&#39;s a sense of you take in stuff very easily. You don&#39;t have your little barricade against the world. If anything, the way it works, especially when you&#39;re younger, I think is you barricade yourself from your own self-conscious, but you don&#39;t barricade yourself from the world. It&#39;s like the defenses are internal. It&#39;s like it all gets turned inside of you, so that you are defending yourself against yourself as opposed to defending yourself against other people. I think it&#39;s probably particularly hard in childhood.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: This is because--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: You can have a childhood in which you could be incredibly rebellious, but nonetheless, you take it in, in some very profound way of like, you can be really-

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: This is a--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: A little battered by the world.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Is this the way it&#39;s always going to be or only when Saturn is retrograde?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Wait the way it&#39;s always going to be for you or the way it always is with Saturn? This is your natal placement. To some extent, that&#39;s a constant for you. The thing to do with it is to learn--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s good though.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, it is good in a lot of ways. Oh, there&#39;s one particular kind of barrier that you don&#39;t have to get through that a lot of people have. On the other hand, it&#39;s caused you a certain amount of pain if you&#39;re not defended against the world in that way.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I see.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That also means that you don&#39;t have to fight so hard to knock down the--You haven&#39;t gotten rigid in your definition of yourself in the world that most people have that then they have to bat down if they&#39;re ever going to go beyond that.

Just in terms of the very basic, general things about the chart, you&#39;re very on the air and fire. A little bit on earth, which is a good thing [laughs] in a chart like this. There&#39;s a lot of things about earth--Virgo in particular, and Virgo energy in particular, is very important, it&#39;s very crucial to you. There&#39;s this whole thing about discipline and ritual, very-

 <br> <strong>Gloria Anazald√∫a</strong>: S√≠.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: -sort of regular setting up rituals for yourself that help you channel your energy is a very critical thing in your life.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: It is [crosstalking].

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s part of your path, basically. We&#39;ll get into that when I talk about your North node. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: OK.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Anyway, but basically, aside from that Virgo stuff going on, it&#39;s mostly air and fire, which is very self-expressive. Self-expression in the sense of there&#39;s a real need to put yourself out there in some way. You hate feelings of restriction. 

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Oh yeah.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: The energy is very much going out, wants to go out all the time. Whereas the earth and water are much more self-contained, sort of gathering in energy.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Any kind of limitations on me, I can&#39;t stand it.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, well, there&#39;s a lot of stuff in here about how you could never do a nine-to-five job if your life depended on it. It&#39;s just not in the cards.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I know, I&#39;ve done it, but I can&#39;t--I just can&#39;t! [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: When I was looking up stuff in your chart, it was funny, there&#39;s about four different things in it say forget the nine-to-five jobs circuit. Everything in your chart says, &quot;No way.&quot; It&#39;s also a particular kind of playfulness to both those, more so than the other ones. Earth and water tend to be a little more somber and a little more-- Everything is gathered in. Can&#39;t remember the difference between centripetal and centrifugal, but the one that goes out is air and fire, and the one that sort of gathers in is earth and water, and you&#39;re heavy on air and fire. It&#39;s good that you have that earth in there, because otherwise you&#39;d be a little too unfocused.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#B3B3E6" data-initial-bg-color="#B3B3E6" data-tags="Zodiac"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Zodiac</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:02:25</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>GA</strong>: I&#39;d be [laughs] spaced out.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not so much spaced out, but just scattered. It&#39;s not like Pisces, that&#39;s real spaced out. It&#39;s sort of running in so many directions at once that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing anymore. A tendency to really exhaust yourself also, because you have so much energy and you have so much you want to do all the time that could get going off in too many directions.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I always want to do everything.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, well, there&#39;s a lot of stuff about that.

[unintelligible 00:03:06] I don&#39;t see you as much of a Virgo, either, although there&#39;s Virgo in your chart. Anyway. Also, you&#39;re very little fixed. It&#39;s mostly mutable, which is the Sag. Mutable or calm. There&#39;s two different ones. [unintelligible 00:03:29] that there&#39;s four different elements, then there&#39;s three different modes, they&#39;re called. There&#39;s cardinal, fixed and mutable. You&#39;re mostly cardinal and mutable. The only thing that&#39;s fixed in the entire chart is Pluto and Leo, and everybody born anywhere around us had Pluto and Leo. It&#39;s a generation thing, it&#39;s not very specific to you.

 <br> Which does mean that you have a tendency to have trouble sticking with things over the long haul, sometimes. On the other hand, it means that you don&#39;t tend to get real rigid around things. You have lots of initiative. The initiative is the cardinal, and that&#39;s the real-- The people who always start things off usually have a cardinal [unintelligible 00:04:20] within whatever element it falls in, its the beginning of that. It&#39;s sort of like the springtime of that particular element or the beginnings of figuring out what that stuff means. With you it&#39;s Ares, cardinal fire.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I&#39;ve got about six books that I&#39;m working on. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. They always have great ideas and tons of initiative and just go out there and they&#39;ll start anything, and they&#39;re very fearless, usually about going out there and doing it, but then they get bored.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s why I have [unintelligible 00:04:52] The novel, I started writing that in &#39;74, and I&#39;m still working on it. That&#39;s almost 10 years.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Libra has that also, sort of initiative. It&#39;s in a different sphere, it&#39;s much more in social stuff. You make connections with people very easily, and you&#39;ll do that. Then you have a fair amount of emphasis on mutable with the Virgo. You have the Venus in Virgo and your midheaven in Virgo and Sag rising. The mutable is distributive. It&#39;s wanting to make the connections between everything, whichever element it&#39;s in.

 <br> While Sag, in particular, is a lot that way of making the connections between philosophical ideas. It&#39;s a lot more communication and sort of putting the stuff out there in a way. The cardinal is the initiation and then the fixed is the consolidating whatever that particular element is. Then you get to the mutable, which is spreading it around in the world. You&#39;re big on starting it and spreading it around the world, and you have a little bit trouble of just sort of [unintelligible 00:06:19] [crosstalk]--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, let somebody else finish it.

That&#39;s the real basic, outlining system. All your planets are in one half, pretty much. This is more out-in-the-world focused, and this is much more of the introverted. Your moon is there, but a lot of, sort of your life is making connections with people. It&#39;s not about just purely probing your own psyche. It&#39;s a lot about putting it out there and honing structures in the world and making connections with people. Especially the 10th house thing, which will be good. There&#39;s more going in your 10th house than anywhere.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: The structures and stuff that I&#39;m putting out, are they mental?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, there&#39;s two things on that. There&#39;s all this 10 path stuff, and a lot of what you&#39;re putting out-- 10th house is-- In traditional astrology it&#39;s the house of the professional, meaning standing in community and that kind of stuff. In your case, it&#39;s more like a thing of making-- It&#39;s a lot about structures. It&#39;s the Capricorn house. It&#39;s the Saturn house, also. It&#39;s building structures in the world. It&#39;s a profession in the sense that you&#39;re building something. It&#39;s a real building house. There&#39;s some real need to do something in the world and to affect the world in some way. That&#39;s a real driving force, and your sun is there. Your sense of purpose, it&#39;s not enough for you to sort of be mountaintop figuring out, you know, whatever. There&#39;s something about needing to make some sort of-- To build something in the world. To build something that is useful to other people.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I have this whole philosophy and this whole yoga, and this whole thing that I call El Mundo Zurdo which I want to present to the world, and I&#39;ve been weaving it in and out of my autobiography, and the problem with the autobiography is all these connections that I want to make.

The ruler, in a way, of your 10th house is this Venus, which is right on. The midheaven is the cusp, or the the very beginning of the 10th house. It&#39;s sort of the focus point of all that stuff about how you-- It&#39;s interesting, because different people read midheaven in slightly different ways. The woman who did my chart last January has this thing about the midheaven. She thinks the midheaven as the most important place in the chart, much more important than the ascendant.

 <br> It&#39;s this particular kind of astrology [unintelligible 00:09:28] that I can&#39;t decide whether I agree with it or not. I can buy that to a certain extent, but she sees the midheaven as the symbol of where you fit, where you fall in the Earth or how you are related to the Earth as a planet and where you are in relation to this global community.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Sort of like your destiny.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes, but it&#39;s your location on this planet as opposed to just you as some sort of abstract. It&#39;s very where you are on the Earth, particularly. [unintelligible 00:09:55] as a point.

It&#39;s very close, one degree. That really colors how you think about all that. Your art, the making. It&#39;s art and it&#39;s a certain sort of looking for the beauty in whatever or looking for the harmony in whatever, and that the creation of beauty and of harmony and integration is absolutely crucial to how you see it. That&#39;s where you see your function in the world a lot, and that&#39;s the stuff you want to put out there. Sounds very--

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: [unintelligible 00:10:36] You&#39;re right about the harmony.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s a real thing about balance. It&#39;s interesting, because Libra--There&#39;s all these connections back and forth. Your sun is in Libra, and the Venus, which is this real strong, absolutely focal planet in terms of all this stuff, is the ruler of Libra. Libra is a very social sign in some ways, and they are very into balance and they don&#39;t really like to fight and they don&#39;t like conflict a whole lot, but they&#39;re not wishy-washy at all. They&#39;re very feisty. They have a real strong sense of justice a lot of the time. They&#39;d rather everything be in balance, but they can get just furious when somebody refuses to let that happen. Do you know what I mean? They can be really fierce fighters, and they would really rather not have to fight at all, but if it comes to that, you better watch out.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: I never get angry, but when I do people just run. [laughs] They don&#39;t want to be around.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s true. That&#39;s perfect Libra. They&#39;re very strong in a particular kind of way, but they&#39;d rather everything be in harmony, but partly they&#39;ll fight for that.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s very interesting.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: There&#39;s these two planets, the Venus and your Mercury, there&#39;s a name for that. See, when one planet is in a sign, there&#39;s a thing called the dispositions. Different planets are ruling over different planets depending on which sign is-- You do little chains all the way around the chart sometimes of the sun is in Sagittarius, which is ruled by Jupiter, which is in whatever, which is ruled by whatever. You get this little chain of things affecting each other that way. Yours, you&#39;ve got your Venus and Mercury are mutual dispositors of each other. They&#39;re very connected that way.

How much is their effect?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, it&#39;s sort of like the 10th house is to houses the way Saturn is to planets and the way Capricorn is to science. There&#39;s one real nice astrology book in which they have-- they just give the numbers to all the planets and all the houses and all the signs and they link up of the first house is the Aries house is ruled by Mars. The second house is the Taurus house is ruled by Venus. It&#39;s that quality to that house but it&#39;s not-- So it has the flavor of Capricorn and Saturn in the sense of both of those, Saturn is the planet of structure and of building structures, and Capricorn is the sign that is the most involved with that stuff. That&#39;s what the 10th house is about.

 <br> It&#39;s not like your 10 house is ruled by Capricorn. Your 10th house in particular is ruled by Virgo, because that&#39;s what&#39;s [unintelligible 00:14:25] or it&#39;s ruled by Mercury. [unintelligible 00:14:30] Anyway, the stuff in terms of putting stuff out there is very much connected with all this 10th house stuff, which I&#39;ll go into some more in a minute. Also, there&#39;s the Mercury in the 11th, which is your intellectual vision, and it&#39;s in the 11th house, which is community. It&#39;s the Aquarian house. It&#39;s community and a utopian vision of the ideal community of the future. It has a lot to do with your friendships and collectivity and however you identify your community, that&#39;s 11th house stuff.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: That&#39;s exactly right.

That&#39;s the place that your communication is directed, is to this some vision of a community.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: S√≠. Especially this past month when I&#39;ve been doing a lot of meditating and a lot of affirmation is coming through, and I&#39;m even getting some training in my sleep from the astroplanes. All this weird stuff is going on [laughs].

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, there&#39;s a lot of real strong visionary stuff in your chart, especially having this-- Well, let&#39;s go back to the 10th house thing. The sun conjunct Mars and Neptune thing is a very powerful little grouping of planets. Your sun essentially it&#39;s your ego, not in the sense they talk of in yoga of you need to get rid of your ego. It&#39;s not that. The sun&#39;s your sense of self in some very deep way.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Is it the soul, the self?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: It&#39;s not even &quot;the self,&quot; because your self is the whole chart. It&#39;s more like your conscious identity. It&#39;s more how you see yourself, how you see yourself very much in the world. It&#39;s a lot about will and sense of purpose and that kind of thing. Your moon is yourself also, but it&#39;s the less conscious, more emotional, reactive, emotional, less purposeful. The sun is like your sense of purpose. It&#39;s how you see yourself as an actor in the world. A lot to do with purpose and will [unintelligible 00:17:05] It&#39;s yourself. It&#39;s conscious identity. You need to be taking care of your sun stuff. If you&#39;re not taking care of your sun stuff you start feeling like you don&#39;t have any purpose in life.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: See, I get very--

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: If you&#39;re not taking care of your moon stuff, you feel emotionally ungrounded, but it&#39;s a very different thing. It&#39;s stuff like you can feel very emotionally grounded and you&#39;re taking care of all your moon stuff or whatever, and feel totally listless in a way, because your sun is sometimes messed up at that [unintelligible 00:17:40] There&#39;s different aspects of yourself, but the conscious, identity purpose kind of thing is the sun.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#B3B3E6" data-initial-bg-color="#B3B3E6" data-tags="Zodiac"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Zodiac</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:17:47</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>GA</strong>: See how it&#39;s only three degrees away from Virgo.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, except that the beginning of the sign is very strong in that sign.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Ah, so it&#39;s not on the cusp?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Well, it is, but the cusp-- Things get mushier at the end of a sign. If you have something that&#39;s 29 degrees, something or other, it&#39;s very much shading over into the next sign. If it&#39;s in the very beginning of a sign, it&#39;s very much that sign. If you&#39;re one or two degrees, something, it&#39;s very strongly that sign, but when you&#39;re in the very end of the one before it&#39;s starting to get mushy. It&#39;s like you&#39;re Neptune and Virgo is really hovering on Libra, but the sun is very strong in Libra. Actually there&#39;s this thing called decans, where they divide the sign up into three pieces, and the first one is the most that sign, in a way. The Libra Libras is the first 10 degrees, and then the second 10 degrees would be the next air sign along, which would be Aquarius. There&#39;s an Aquarian tinge to those Libras.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes. You&#39;re going to like this book.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Oh, that&#39;s so [unintelligible 00:19:14] Anyway, okay. This conjunction here are those three planets. Sun conjunct Neptune in itself is-- actually [unintelligible 00:19:29]. All three outer planets are in some ways mystical, spiritual stuff to them, but in very different flavors. Neptune is the real oceanic, at-one-with-the-world, complete loss of ego, that kind of spirituality. I mean it&#39;s ocean. That&#39;s all I can think of is ocean, and this real sense of being very much at one with everything and peaceful and also very prone to-- It&#39;s also a planet of illusion and just being lost in stuff and drugs. People who have screwed up Neptunes are way into drugs. When there&#39;s problems with your Neptune, there&#39;s a real problem dealing with reality, altogether.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: A large part of my life is like that.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Yes. It&#39;s a very hard aspect that way. You have a vision of how connected everything is and of how it should be that way and how everyone should be feeling that. The fact that the world as you have to live it day to day is so far from that is so horrible that there&#39;s a real tendency to just withdraw into yourself and build your own fantasy world, because there&#39;s this incredible--You have a sense of such empathy with all the stuff around you. There&#39;s all the violence or the whatever or the horrible stuff that&#39;s going on in the world. It&#39;s just too much to deal with alongside that feeling of connectedness with everything.

You&#39;ve got all this stuff in here about problems with growing a thick skin. I imagine you&#39;re a whole lot better at it now, but definitely when you were a kid of just the thing of having almost no psychic defenses and just the world just completely flooding in on you all the time.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Is that because of Neptune conjunct with sun?

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: That&#39;s a lot because of Neptune. It&#39;s also because of your Saturn is retrograde, which is different, but it also has to do with not being very well defended against the world, psychically. Especially with sun conjunct Neptune. There really is this thing of a real strong, empathic connection with everything living around you.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Like it hurt me when people were turning off the cigarettes on the grass. The grass is alive.

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: Right, that kind of stuff. It could be really agonizing on some level to be that in tune with what&#39;s going on. This is the problem with people with strong Neptune things is you&#39;re so aware of everyone&#39;s pain or everyone&#39;s whatever that you can&#39;t deal with it. It&#39;s like having skin of parchment or something. You&#39;re feeling everything&#39;s pain and everybody&#39;s pain and everybody&#39;s whatever. Even good stuff can be completely overwhelming because you&#39;ve got everybody&#39;s.

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Then I tend to go the opposite way, to become callous, just in self-protection. [laughs]

 <br> <strong>LB</strong>: You never really manage very well to be callous, I imagine. Probably callous by your standards is not callous by other people&#39;s standards. There&#39;s also, one of the things that people with that kind of stuff tend to do is withdraw into a real fantasy world. I have a moon in Pisces, a really strong moon in Pisces, which is similar stuff. It works in a different way than mine, because yours is much more connected with your sun, which means in some ways that you have a hard time getting a handle on who the hell you are.

 <br> Especially when you were a kid, I imagine, had a really hard time figuring out who you were and what you wanted to do in the world and what your sense of purpose was or what your own value was, even, because, first of all, it was really difficult for you to separate out yourself from everything else around. There wasn&#39;t a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way. If you feel like you&#39;re unequipped to deal with the world. Everyone else seems to wander around not getting upset about the grass, and [unintelligible 00:24:01]

 <br> <strong>GA</strong>: Yes, I couldn&#39;t believe these people. I hope you have a pen, because I don&#39;t have any cartridges.

I&#39;m just going to go and do as much as I can possibly do.

<strong>Amy</strong>: What I do want to do-- You&#39;ve had your charts done before haven&#39;t you?   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Yes, not very formally. I worked at a place where everybody--   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: Had their chart done.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Yes. Where a person who was-- I worked in this house food place and then  a woman who did a lot of astrology had done my chart but between breaks she  would show me it.   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: Oh, I see.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: It wasn&#39;t like we had a real formal thing.   <br>

That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, &quot;Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.&quot; What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it&#39;s just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.   <br> 

What this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn&#39;t just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It&#39;s saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, &quot;Yes, this is who I am. I&#39;m the power and what I want is right for everybody.&quot;   <br> 

Now where&#39;s Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherri√© is always a blessing except when it&#39;s in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.   <br> 

Having Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that&#39;s the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn&#39;t start off  saying, &quot;Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I&#39;m just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.&quot; It&#39;s saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.   <br> 

All right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you&#39;re breaking away is by seeing the truth that you&#39;re breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it&#39;s all illusions.   <br> 

It&#39;s not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It&#39;s telling you that you&#39;ve been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It&#39;s not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You&#39;ve already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don&#39;t have to see, &quot;Oh gee, what is power? I can&#39;t use it blah blah blah.&quot;   <br> 

In fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it&#39;s saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I&#39;m  not here.&quot; Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, &quot;Who me, Cherri√©? Oh no, not me. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking  about. What power? I got no power.&quot;   <br> 

Yet at the same time, the people are there saying, &quot;Oh, Cherri√© she doesn&#39;t have any  power.?&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;What do you mean I don&#39;t any? Hey, listen, I have all this power  and I got to use this power. Here I am.&quot; Then it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh my God, what did I do?&quot;  &quot;Oh, no. No, I was just kidding. Just kidding, folks. No, I don&#39;t have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.&quot; It goes back and forth. There are some days in  which you&#39;re right up there, you&#39;re right there looking straight into your destiny and  saying, &quot;Yes, this is who I am, and this is who I have to be.&quot; Other days you&#39;re just  looking at that and saying, &quot;Oh my God, I can&#39;t possibly accept this power. This is  just much too scary. It&#39;s much too much. No, I can&#39;t deal with it.&quot;   <br> 

It is this duality of saying, &quot;Yes, I want it. No, I don&#39;t. Yes, I&#39;ve got to have it. No, I  can&#39;t.&quot; What you&#39;re trying to do is to find the perfect balance, is to be able to be a  channel of that power, accept your power, but not feel that you have to take on too  much of the power and not feel that you can&#39;t accept yourself as you truly are. It&#39;s a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it&#39;s saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it. That&#39;s a really  important energy with the T.   <br> </p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#B3B3E6" data-initial-bg-color="#B3B3E6" data-tags="Zodiac"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Zodiac</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:16:01</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>Amy</strong>: Now every T-square has a point where it needs to balance because it is a T. There is  no planet on the chart because if there was a planet, then you wouldn&#39;t have a T at  all, you&#39;d have a cross, which is a completely different energy. That missing planet is  called the void. It is directly opposite the stem. Your stem is in Taurus. Your void  then would be in Scorpio in the first house.   <br> 

Now, the first house is the house of self-identity, and Scorpio is power. What this  says is that the thing that you really need to do is to identify with the truth of your  power. The truth that you are a divine warrior in this lifetime. I mean, you really have  to be. There&#39;s lots of things that you have to get out there and confront that Cherrie  and her Libra essence would rather not deal with it all.   <br> 

Your Libras, there&#39;re going, &quot;What? Me? Oh no, not me. I&#39;m just sitting here spacing  out.&quot; Whereas that Scorpio energy is right in there. It&#39;s going, &quot;You are a divine  warrior. You got to get out there. You have to clothe yourself in the truth. You have to hold the sword of truth and you have to communicate it. You have to be it.&quot; There&#39;s a  lot of parts of you that are in there saying, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to look at this destiny  because it hurts. Besides it&#39;s scary. Can&#39;t I just stay here and live in a little house on  the ocean and not look at anything.&quot;   <br> 

You&#39;re being told, &quot;Uh-uh, Uh-uh, you got to get out there and confront.&quot; That&#39;s the  thing that&#39;s really scary, is that sense of, &quot;Oh, I&#39;ve really got to get out there and  confront. I&#39;ve really got to get out there and deal with the energy.&quot; The other side of it  is it says that you&#39;ve got to really use that power that for many lifetimes you&#39;ve been  sitting on it and really saying, &quot;I&#39;m not ready, I&#39;m not ready. I can&#39;t use it. I&#39;ll just blow  it again. I&#39;ll blow it again.&quot; This lifetime, you&#39;re right there. It&#39;s like your divine energy  has come right down to you and it&#39;s saying to you, &quot;Okay, Cherrie, this is the time.  This is it. You really have to use the energy. You cannot possibly ignore this.&quot;   <br> 

You&#39;re finding yourself having to really deal with that energy, having to accept it in  spite of yourself. Now, the fact that the Scorpio is in the void does not mean that you  don&#39;t connect to Scorpios. As a matter of fact, what it says is that at times Scorpios  can be incredible catalysts to your life. Because it&#39;s almost like their energy,  especially if their sun or any planet that they have fits into the void. It&#39;s saying that  then that energy really helps you to realize the T-square energy. Of course, Barbara  is a Scorpio. I don&#39;t know if her son, I can&#39;t remember what the degree of her son is,  so I don&#39;t know if it fits into this or not. Do you know what day she was born on-- November?   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: I&#39;m just forgetting. Oh, no. 17th.   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: 17th. There is a real good chance that her Sun would fit into this void. That  would just be an interesting thing because it would say that in her very essence  would help you to work out this T-square energy. That&#39;s just an interesting [crosstalk]   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Yes, makes sense.

Now you also have a Yod. Now a Yod is a partially  resolved T-Square. It&#39;s as if you&#39;ve gotten a T-square and almost worked it out to  completion, but just didn&#39;t quite manage to get it totally synthesized, like in another  life. A Yod is called a Yod because actually Yod is the Hebrew letter for Y, and it is a  Y shape. You&#39;ve got two sets of planets that are 60 degrees away from each other.  They form a 60-degree angle, then both of them are 150 degrees away from the  stem point.   <br> 

It&#39;s interesting that the stem point here is also Jupiter. Jupiter is the stem for both the  T Square and the Yod. What this says is that you have to be really careful at pushing  yourself too hard. It&#39;s like you&#39;ve wanted to get through this karma so badly that  you&#39;ve almost decided in past lives that you were just going to burn straight through  it. You had at least in one lifetime, I know of at least one in which you were just, ugh. You just decided, lay it on me Lord. It was just like, &quot;Okay, I am just going to totally  burn through this. I am not going to get stuck in this again.&quot; You did have, I don&#39;t  know if it was your last lifetime or the lifetime for it but it was incredibly painful. It was  very much involved in this intense victimization experience. Your death was a particularly incredibly horrible death where you died. You were raped and murdered  in your death and it was just this incredible thing [crosstalk] to sustain. Pardon?   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: I was saying, why does it feel so recent? 

<strong>Amy</strong>: Recent? [inaudible 00:21:16] I&#39;m with you. 

<strong>CM</strong>: When you said that, it felt so recent. 

<strong>Amy</strong>: Oh, yes. It was so traumatic for your soul. Yet, see, the thing that was so  intense about it is that in this really weird way, you engineered it because it was  almost like you said, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s it. Okay, maybe I victimized some people. Well,  I&#39;m just going to burn right through it. I&#39;m just going to rip it off my soul because I&#39;m  not going to deal with this anymore.&quot; See, I feel like your misuse of power was  probably a number of lifetimes ago and you started off dealing with it more  intellectually, and you got very frustrated where you felt like, I have to get back to  using this power. I can&#39;t stand being impotent and not being able to use the power. 

What you decided to do was to just sear it right off of you and you had this life. It was  weird because it&#39;s almost like you didn&#39;t have to go through it. It&#39;s like you just got  this thing in your head that you had to release the energy and it&#39;s like you couldn&#39;t  realize that the way you had to release it was to forgive yourself. It was you couldn&#39;t  forgive yourself. You were so tied into this idea that somehow you were really evil,  that you couldn&#39;t just say, &quot;Hey, look, just forgive yourself. Let it go.&quot; 

It was almost like in that lifetime, things just kept happening to you that were  incredible. It was almost like one of those catastrophic lifetimes where you just could  think, what next? How could something else happen to this woman? Yet you would  just keep walking right into it. It was like, this isn&#39;t hard enough. This isn&#39;t heavy  enough. I&#39;m not going to be convinced that I&#39;m released until I hit something really  heavy. 

Finally, when you went into that death, it was about the heaviest thing that could  possibly happen to you. It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing? You don&#39;t have to go through this.  Are you crazy? What it set up there Cherrie, is this real, almost like this intense self hatred because you felt like, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I did this. Talk about stupid.&quot; Then in this  lifetime, you have to forgive yourself doubly because not only do you have to forgive  yourself for the misuse of power but you have to forgive yourself for your ultimate  victimization. That in a way is the hardest because you really have forgiven yourself  for the power.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#B3B3E6" data-initial-bg-color="#B3B3E6" data-tags="Zodiac,Jupiter,Mars"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Zodiac</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Jupiter</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Mars</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:31:24</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>Amy</strong>: The other thing you have to realize is, because your moon is trying your Pluto, you  have a really really strong guardian angel, and your guardian angel is right there to  protect you, to make sure that it&#39;s okay, to make sure that it&#39;s all right for you to  accept your energy, to make sure that it&#39;s okay for you to be who you really are. It&#39;s  saying that it&#39;s going to protect you, not just physically, but psychically as well. It&#39;s  really, really important for you to accept that psychic energy, and it&#39;s really important  for you to really trust that energy inside of yourself and know that you do not have to  take on the pain and you do not have to take on the negativity.  <br> 

The key, as I&#39;m going back to my original thing, is the Jupiter, because what that  Jupiter is saying is that in this lifetime, you just have to be very careful not to push  too hard. When you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, you have got to pull  back. There&#39;s a difference between just sort of normal fear and being overwhelmed.  The fear is just like, okay, you&#39;re afraid, but you still feel the energy. You still feel like  I&#39;ve got the energy, I&#39;ve got the strength, I&#39;ve got the power, I&#39;ve just got to go with it.  There&#39;s a difference between that and that panicky, overwhelming feeling of just like,  &quot;Oh, my God, I&#39;m just exhausted, I&#39;m drained. I don&#39;t have any energy. I cannot do  this.&quot;  <br> 

It&#39;s really really important for you to know that you have to let go of this energy. It&#39;s  really important for you to know that you do not have to pick up on it, that you do  have to release yourself and feel the release because it&#39;s just a really important  energy for you, it&#39;s something you need to experience deep inside of yourself. Okay,  now, the other way that the Yod works is, okay, so then you split and you&#39;ve got  these two battery of planets. First of all, you&#39;ve got the moon conjunct to Mars. Now,  the moon is the intuitive, subconscious part of yourself and Mars is action energy. It&#39;s  motivation. Now, this says Cherrie, that you get guided intensely intuitively all the  time.  <br> </p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#DC8F8D" data-initial-bg-color="#DC8F8D" data-tags="Mercury"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Mercury</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:33:52</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>Amy</strong>: You are always experiencing a very, very deep guidance energy. It&#39;s saying that you  really have to pay attention to this guidance. Now, the problem is that the guidance  comes intuitively and that it&#39;s really, really easy for you to block that intuition. It&#39;s  really, really easy for you to not connect to that truth inside of yourself at times,  because your sun is conjunct to your mercury, which means that Mercury&#39;s mental  energy sun is being-ness. You just accept your mind energy. Your mind really comes  in there and it really says, &quot;What are you talking about, Cherrie? What&#39;s this? What  do you mean, what are you talking about? How can you believe this?&quot; It&#39;s saying that  you pick up on energy all the time.   <br> 

I walk into this room and you&#39;ve never seen me before, and sure, your mind&#39;s going  to look at me and say, &quot;Oh, so that&#39;s Amy, and she looks like this, and she does this  and blah, and blah,&quot; but your intuition is going to look at me and say, &quot;Oh, so that&#39;s  Amy. Well, she&#39;s this, she&#39;s that. She said something.&quot; Nine out of ten times, you&#39;re  absolutely right with your intuition. The problem is that your mind comes in and it  says to you, &quot;What the hell are you talking about, Cherrie? You don&#39;t even know this  person. How do you know that this is going on?&quot; Especially because you don&#39;t just  do it about people, you do it about rooms and dogs and cats and books and  situations.   <br> 

You could walk into a room and maybe it&#39;s a beautiful room and there&#39;s all kinds of  nice people there. You say, &quot;There&#39;s a lot of tension here.&quot; Maybe someone with you  is saying &quot;Cherrie are you crazy? Are you out of your mind, everything&#39;s fine. What&#39;s  wrong with know?&quot; And maybe say, your mind goes, oh, yes. Boy, are you stupid?  [inaudible 00:35:39]. Then, you know, maybe three weeks later when a friend  comes to you and says, &quot;Well, Cherrie, you remember we went to that party and there  was this stuff. I didn&#39;t realize it, but there was all this stuff going on between so and  so and so and so. They just had this big fight, and they&#39;re not living together  anymore, and blah and blah.&quot;  <br>  

You&#39;re saying to yourself, &quot;That was the tension that I felt.&quot; Now, the problem is that  your mind has absolutely no conscience. That lots of times what happens is it says  to you, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re full of shit? What&#39;s wrong with you? You can&#39;t trust such and  such.&quot; Then when weeks later, you find out that such and such is true, your mind has  no qualms about coming back and saying to you, &quot;Cherrie, you knew that that was  true. Why didn&#39;t you do something about it? Oh, boy, you&#39;re stupid. I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;  It&#39;s the kind of thing where, see, your mind will switch sides. It doesn&#39;t care. It just  wants to be right.   <br> 

That&#39;s why it&#39;s really important for you to give enough credence to your own intuition  because you get guided so much. I cannot stress how much you are guided. You get such strong guidance energy, and yet at the same time, it&#39;s really easy for you to  negate that guidance. Lots of times it&#39;s like running around the rose bush. You go  around and around and around, and finally, you&#39;re so exhausted, you just give up,  and you just give into the intuition. Then you realize that you just should have given  into it a long time ago. You say, &quot;Oh, wow, this was right. What&#39;s wrong with me?  This was absolutely right. Why wasn&#39;t I trusting this energy?&quot;   <br> 

It is just really really important for you to make sure that you do trust this energy, and  you do know that it is absolutely right for you, and you do know that this is the right  energy, and you can give yourself a lot of support for what you&#39;re actually feeling and  realizing that that&#39;s exactly right for you. It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;ve got to be feeling at  this time. The other thing that goes along with that is just the realization that you  really need to follow your hunches. You just get hunches about everything, and  they&#39;re really gut-level. Lots of times you don&#39;t follow them because you are scared,  because you think, who am I to have these kinds of hunches? Obviously, they can&#39;t  be true. They&#39;re not true.   <br> 

Then in reality, you wish that you had followed them. Now, the moon energy is the  intuitive energy. It&#39;s also one of the female energies because it&#39;s the real mother  nurturance. It&#39;s like the goddess energy, and Mars Is the so-called male energy.  Because your moon is conjunct to Mars, it&#39;s saying that you really have to synthesize  your male energy inside of yourself. Because what happened after you went through  that rape and murder, I mean, obviously you just [unintelligible 00:38:31] to your  male energy. You just said, &quot;All right, that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t connect to it.&quot; The problem is,  that it&#39;s your male energy that holds your power.   <br> 

You&#39;ve been trying to get it into your female energy, but your male energy isn&#39;t about  to let it go, not now, anyway. What you need to do is you need to synthesize your  male energy into your female energy. As long as you hate your male energy, you&#39;re  not going to be able to serve your power. It&#39;s really really important for you to accept  that male energy into yourself. Now, you don&#39;t have to term it male energy. It&#39;s just  the so-called male energy. It&#39;s just that power. It&#39;s that aggression, it&#39;s that ability to  really focus, to really deal outside of yourself. You have identified it as your male  energy in past lives. As far as you&#39;re concerned, you still identify it as your male  energy.   <br> 

That it&#39;s really important for you to really bring that back into yourself and get it to  really hook up with your female energy and get it to really hook up as a positive  energy. As long as you see that power as negative, as long as you see that power as  an ability to hurt, you&#39;re not going to be able to be 100% effective. It&#39;s really  important for you to draw it back into yourself and to really tie it up to your goddess  energy and really accept it in the depths of your soul.

It&#39;s one big, huge ball of energy. Now, this says a number  of things. First of all, Saturn is karmic energy. Neptune is healing energy and  spirituality and Venus&#39;s love energy. Now this does a lot of different things. First of  all, one of the things that it does is it says that you really are working out still a lot of  karma around relationships. In that past life, you really just close down your heart  chakra.  <br> 

You just said, &quot;Oh, see, it was my heart that got me into this trouble. It was my heart  that got me open to this energy. I&#39;ve just got to really not put myself in that place. I&#39;ve  got to not put myself in that space.&quot; What you did is you just shut down your heart  chakra and you just said, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s it. No more.&quot; In this lifetime, you&#39;re reopening  it. However, because of that incredible pain and hurt you sustained, you&#39;re not about  to open your heart chakra easily.   <br> 

In fact, lots of times you feel very dualized between the part of you that wants to  experience the love and is there saying to you, &quot;Now, Cherie, you&#39;ve got to open up.  You&#39;ve got to open up.&quot; The part of you that say, &quot;Are you crazy? I&#39;m not going to  open up. You&#39;ve got to be out of your mind. I am not going to open up. I am not  going to experience this energy. I refuse to.&quot; Yet at the same time, the real sense of,  &quot;No, you&#39;ve really got to open up this energy. You&#39;ve really got to experience this  love that&#39;s inside of you.&quot;  <br>

You have what&#39;s known as a  soulmate or a karmic mate. This is a person that you have been involved with in past  lives in many different ways. You may have been her lover, you may have been even  enemies, or parent and child, or teacher and student, or siblings, or colleagues, or all  kinds of things, and in this lifetime, you come together with the potential to be one  with each other on all levels, mentally, physically, psychically, sexually, emotionally,  spiritually, every single level you can think of, you have the ability to be one with this  person.   <br> 

However, there is no way to tell if someone is your soulmate by what sign she is, by  what the person looks like, by what they do, by when you meet this person. There is  no way to tell by any external means. The only way to tell when a person is your  soulmate is by the fulfillment of different indications. There are also ways to tell  because this relationship is not a lot of things. It is definitely not in any way, shape,  or form an abusive relationship. It cannot possibly be an abusive relationship. It is  also not in any way, shape, or form a relationship that does not allow you to be your  true self. This person has got to totally support you in your true destiny, just as you  must support her in her true destiny.  <br>  

Now one of the indications is the fact that you find you cannot separate from this  person, literally, physically. No matter how much you try to be apart, there is some  greater force than yourself bringing you together so that you find that you can meet  this person and maybe at first you don&#39;t feel a big thing. Maybe you meet this person  at a party or a bar or a conference or a meeting or something like that and you might  feel like, &quot;Oh.&quot; Somehow you&#39;re going to keep connecting to this person. It&#39;s like,  &quot;Look, Cherie, this is the person. This is it,&quot; which is why you can never meet the  person and then do nothing and then someday wake up when you&#39;re 85 and in the middle of the night and say   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: She is the one. [crosstalk]-   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: -&quot;Oh my God, it was that birth and then I blew it.&quot; It&#39;s not like that. You get  chance after chance after chance, which is why even if you&#39;re together and you feel  like, &quot;Oh, fuck, I don&#39;t want to deal with this.&quot; Forget it. You find that you&#39;ve got to be  there. You&#39;ve got to work it out together. The second qualification is the fact that you are willing to put more into this relationship than any other relationship you have ever  experienced. This relationship forces you to go beyond your own ego and your own  sense of self and it&#39;s mutual. You are both working out this relationship energy, so  it&#39;s not like you can&#39;t do it. It&#39;s like you are forced to deal with it. You are forced to do it. You find that in spite of yourself, your head might be going, &quot;No way, Cherie, why  should you work it out? Forget it. You are not going to work it out,&quot; and your heart is  saying, &quot;You get in there and you work it out. You are not about to not work it out.&quot;  You find that you cannot help but work out the relationship. You find that you cannot  help but deal with this relationship in a complete way.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: It&#39;s terrifying. [laughs]   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: I know it is.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Just saying.   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: It is. The third qualification is the fact that the relationship itself follows a  certain pattern. First, there&#39;ll be a plateau and everything will be very nice and very  easy and very lovely. Little by little, it builds up to some kind of crisis point. Now it  might be your crisis, it might be the other person&#39;s crisis, it might be internal, it might  be external, but it&#39;s some kind of crisis point. You find that the more you&#39;re able to  work out the crisis point, the more able you are to love each other, to be together, to  experience oneness with each other. Then it goes to another plateau until it builds up  to another crisis point. The amount of time between the crisis points depends upon  the couple.   <br> 

For some couples, it&#39;s every two minutes, and for other couples, it&#39;s every five years.  It just depends on what it is that you&#39;re working out. The fourth qualification is the fact  that you find it&#39;s really difficult to explain why you love this person. You can&#39;t explain  it. It goes beyond explanation. Cause you feel like, &quot;I love her because she&#39;s so-- No, that&#39;s  not it. It must be because she&#39;s-- No, that&#39;s not it. I think it&#39;s because of-- No, that&#39;s  not it.&quot; You find that you just cannot possibly explain it. It&#39;s just, it&#39;s so deep. It feels  so intense inside of yourself. You cannot explain it in any way, shape, or form. It&#39;s a  really deep energy. All you can do is really trust that energy and know that this is  exactly the right energy for you.  <br> </p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#CBE364" data-initial-bg-color="#CBE364" data-tags="Saturn,Neptune,Venus,Mars,Jupiter"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Saturn</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Neptune</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Venus</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Mars</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Jupiter</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:46:59</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>Amy</strong>: What the soulmate indication does is it guarantees that you will meet this person.  What you do after that its up to you. It doesn&#39;t say, &quot;Oh, and you&#39;ll live happily ever  after.&quot; You still have to work out the relationship. Obviously, for you, it&#39;s a very  intense energy because you do have a real struggle opening up your heart.  Obviously, this person is definitely going to open up your heart, and she is not going  to allow you to close down. The other thing is that it&#39;s really forcing you to let go of  pain around relationship. It&#39;s forcing you to work out sexuality, and it&#39;s forcing you to  open up to the truth inside of yourself. It&#39;s forcing you to say, &quot;Yes, this is who I really  have to be. I can not be anybody else.&quot;   <br> 

Now the other thing it says is that with the Saturn conjuncture Neptune that in this  lifetime, you really have to use your healing energy in your work. Of course, you can  only do that when you experience love in your heart, and that you really have to experience a deep openness and a deep energy inside of yourself, and that you just  have to know that this is the truth, that you have really got to experience the truth  inside of yourself. You&#39;ve really got to experience the knowledge that you are a  healer in this lifetime and that you&#39;re really meant to use the love that you&#39;re feeling  from other people to learn to love yourself, to learn to forgive yourself.   <br> 

The key here is self-forgiveness, it is self-acceptance, and it&#39;s the knowledge that all  you can do is really, really be open to this truth. All you can do is really, really be  open to what you know is true inside of yourself. Now Saturn, Neptune, and Venus  are sextile the moon and Mars. This is interesting because then Venus is sextile the  Mars, which is the union of the so-called male-female energy. It does say that when  they work together, you feel a real sense of completeness and openness inside of  yourself.   <br> 

Then these are both in conjunct to Jupiter, which says that at times you feel a real  duality between that really active part of you, the real so-called male aggressive,  active, powerful part of you, and then the real victimization part of you so that what  you&#39;re trying to do is to switch energy. You&#39;re trying to get the male energy part of  you to experience nurturing, to experience love, to experience hope, to experience  transformation. You&#39;re trying to get the female part of you to stop being the victim  because that female part of you still really identifies with the victim. You need to get  her to feel strong, to feel strength to power, aggression, all the things that you want  to feel. You&#39;re switching the energy.   <br> 

That&#39;s what the Yod is talking about is the real switch of energy will allow you to  release yourself from that duality because it says at times, you really experience that  duality, and it is very confusing to you. Here you are, one day, you can be so strong  and so aggressive and totally like, &quot;No, I do not experience this pain inside of  myself.&quot; Then the next day, you can just totally fold in on yourself and experience  real victimization.   <br> 

It&#39;s very confusing to you because you feel like, &quot;What is going on?&quot; Of course, then  too, you&#39;re giving real mixed messages to people. Both I&#39;m invincible, I am strong,  and I&#39;m the complete victim. Then you&#39;re feeling like, &quot;What the hell? What kind of  credibility do I have that I&#39;m expressing both of these energies?&quot; Yet they&#39;re both  there because they&#39;re both a part of you. What you&#39;re trying to do is to give power to  the victim and give compassion and love to the assertive part of you so that both of  them experience a synthesis and a connection inside of yourself, and that&#39;s a really  strong work that you&#39;re experiencing at this time. [chuckles]   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: I know it&#39;s so much.   <br>

The reason why this is coming up so strongly now is that you are starting about a six-year cycle. That is a very important cycle for you. It&#39;s like you started it  actually years ago. You started it about four years ago. You started this very important Saturn experience, and then you had a respite. You had a rest for about a  year, and now you&#39;re starting it again.   <br> 

First Saturn in the sky as you know is continually moving. You happen to have all  this stuff back to back. As you can see, you have so many planets right here. Now  what happened is that you have Saturn, it passed over your 10th house. The 10th  house is the house of work, and Saturn rules work.   <br> 

When Saturn passes through the 10th house, it says then that you really are  experiencing a real need to deal with your work energy. That was happening, I think  it was around &#39;78. Let me just check. It started at 11 degrees of Leo. You started  experiencing it starting in September of &#39;76, actually. You started experiencing it. It  continued until September of &#39;79. That was over a three-year period. Then you had a  little bit of a respite. Then starting last September, so September of 1980, you  started experiencing it again very intensely, and you will continue experiencing it for  quite a while.   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: Now, is that specifically around work again, or this is something [crosstalk]?   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: No, now it&#39;s something else. Okay? Now what you&#39;re experiencing is a number  of things because first of all, you have your sun in Libra. You also have Saturn in  Libra, and you have your ascendant in Libra. I know you have your ascendant in  Scorpio, excuse me, but your 12th house is ruled by Libra. Whenever Saturn passes  over the sun or Saturn or the 12th house, it creates a very deep experience. Now  your sun is in the same sign as your Saturn and your Saturn is in your 12th house.  It&#39;s like having three different cycles all back to back, all affecting you all at the same  time. That&#39;s a very intense energy for you. [crosstalk]   <br> 

<strong>CM</strong>: It started in September?   <br> 

<strong>Amy</strong>: It started in September. Now what it does is it affects you on all these different  level. First of all, it affects you with your sun. What it says is that you are then having  to confront all of your own limitations at this time, and you really have to deal with all  the limitations that you create inside of yourself. Also, you&#39;re in your Saturn return, and the Saturn cycle affects you in a lot of different ways.   <br> 

First of all, one of the ways it affects you is that it really forces you to really let go of your childhood and to accept your adult energy so that all of a sudden, you, Cherrie,  are learning to be an adult in a total way. Now what that means is that you&#39;re  empowering yourself. You&#39;re really accepting your power and your identity on a  whole new level, on a level that you have never experienced before. It&#39;s saying then that you really need to deal with a lot of different issues with your Saturn cycle.   <br> 

The first issue is the issue of letting go of your childhood, which means that all of a  sudden, all these things that you have really associated with your childhood. All the  things that you haven&#39;t felt ready to deal with, you really have to deal with now. It&#39;s really connecting and confronting that energy. Really being able to look at it, really  being able to say, &quot;Yes, this is something that I really have to deal with. This is  something that I really have to connect to. This is something that I really have to  confront inside of myself.&quot; Now the second thing that&#39;s going on with this is the  realization that you also then have to deal with your work.   <br> 

One of the ways that we decide whether a person is an adult or not is by their work,  which is why obviously for so long women were never considered adults. [chuckles]  You are really looking at your work now and deciding what you&#39;re going to do with it. You&#39;ve got three choices. Either what work you&#39;ve been doing so far isn&#39;t your true  work, and now that you&#39;re in your Saturn cycle, you have to let go of it, and you have  to accept your true work, or you&#39;ve just been doing something that was really right for  you, and it was your true work, but now it&#39;s changing, and you&#39;re accepting a new  energy because you&#39;re now going to another level, or what you&#39;ve been doing has  been your true work, but now you&#39;re really broadening it and extending it and  experiencing it on a whole new level.   <br> 

It&#39;s saying that it&#39;s very, very, very important for you to really get in touch with  experiencing that transformational energy and knowing that now is a time for you to  let go of your past and to really accept your future. You do this in a number of ways.  First of all, the first step in the Saturn cycle is figuring out what you really don&#39;t want.  It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re in there cleaning out your psychic closets and you&#39;re saying,  &quot;Okay, well, I don&#39;t need this anymore and I don&#39;t need this anymore and I don&#39;t need  this anymore. I really don&#39;t need to let go of this energy. I don&#39;t need to hold onto this  energy. I can let go of it. I am going to let go of it, and I&#39;m really going to accept a  new energy deep inside of myself.&quot;   <br> 

The next step is figuring out what you really do want. That&#39;s harder because it comes  in dribs and drabs. It&#39;s learning how to be quiet enough and open enough to accept  that energy. It&#39;s learning how to say, &quot;Oh, okay, I&#39;ve really got to learn how to accept  this energy. I&#39;ve really got to be open to accepting this truth inside of myself and  knowing that this is exactly the right energy for myself.&quot;   <br> 

It&#39;s slowly and surely getting in touch with the energy and learning how to be open to  that energy in a really good way. Now the third thing that happens with the Saturn  cycle is because the etheric body of adulthood, consciousness of adulthood is  actually connecting to your real physical body. You&#39;re really changing your  connection to other people who used to be adults to you. Your connection to your  parents can change because they&#39;re no longer your parents. It&#39;s like you are now an  adult. You are peers now.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#CBE364" data-initial-bg-color="#CBE364" data-tags="Saturn"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Saturn</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">01:03:24</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"><strong>Amy</strong>: One of the things that happens in the Saturn Cycle is you come face-to-face with  your own mortality because children never die. Children don&#39;t die. Even when they&#39;re  dying, they don&#39;t die. It&#39;s because they don&#39;t have a real sense of their mortality, but  adults die. All of a sudden, now, you&#39;re really confronting that mortality, and you&#39;re  grieving for the loss of your childhood. It&#39;s really easy in your Saturn cycle to  experience a great deal of grief, and you&#39;ve just got to let it come right through you.  Also, you&#39;re grieving for the death of your parents no matter what shape your parents  are in. Whether they&#39;re alive or not, whether they&#39;re healthy or not, you&#39;re going to  grieve for their death because they&#39;re no longer your parents.  <br> 

You realize that you are an adult, they&#39;re adults, they are dying. That&#39;s a real intense  energy for people to deal with. Another thing that happens is that you really have to  deal with your own insecurity because being in your Saturn cycle, it&#39;s really, really  easy to feel insecure. It&#39;s that feeling of like, &quot;Oh, everything&#39;s changing. I&#39;m in a  kaleidoscope now. I want everything to be the same. I want everything to be secure,  and yet, somehow it isn&#39;t.&quot; One of the things you&#39;re really working on is you&#39;re really  allowing yourself to break through that insecurity. You&#39;re really, really allowing  yourself to know what it is that you have to do.   <br> 

You&#39;re really being able to say, &quot;Okay, I know that what it is that I have to do is really  accept the truth inside of myself. I know that what I have to do is really be able to  know that my only security is my truth, is my destiny, and I can&#39;t try to pin it on  anything else.&quot; It is an insecure time. It is a painful time, but it&#39;s also a time of  releasing the past and accepting your true identity.   <br> 

Now the fact that Saturn will soon be moving through your 12th house. Right now, it&#39;s  still in your 11th house. It&#39;s a little bit of a respite, and it will start getting into your  12th house. Let&#39;s see, it has to hit 13 degrees. It&#39;ll be in your 12th house by your-- let&#39;s see, is it by [unintelligible 01:05:55]? No, it&#39;s by next October. It&#39;s October of  &#39;81. It&#39;ll go back into your 12th house.   <br> 

Starting in October of &#39;81, you&#39;re going to feel as if circumstances are forcing you to  release negative energy, to release your limitations. It&#39;s almost as if this really strong  force comes down into you and takes this really high-powered flashlight, and is  looking in all the corners and under the bed and in the closets and saying, &quot;Okay,  now you got to really deal with this shit. You&#39;ve got to really deal with this shit,&quot; yet it  affects you outwardly, externally.   <br> 

As an example, one person I knew who was going through this. Her lover was  someone she really didn&#39;t want to be with yet she was really holding onto it because  she didn&#39;t want to hurt her lover&#39;s feelings. Then when Saturn was in her 12th house,  her lover said, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be with you anymore.&quot; At first, of course, the woman  was feeling really frustrated and really angry.   <br> 

Then she realized what a fool she was. It was like, &quot;Oh God, I feel relieved.&quot; This is  what you really wanted. It&#39;s that kind of energy where sometimes things happen, and  yet when they happen, at first, you might feel a real frustration or a real anger, but  then you realize it&#39;s exactly what you want it to happen. It&#39;s this thing of like, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m  so pleased. I&#39;m so thankful that this happened. Now I don&#39;t have to carry it anymore.&quot;   <br> 

Realize it&#39;s starting in October of &#39;81, you will be going through this period of time in  which external circumstances are forcing you to grow, and yet you know that that is  the best thing that could happen to you. You realize that all the things that are  happening, they&#39;re the things that you really wanted to happen, and yet at the time, it  might feel very scary to you and might feel very difficult to you. It&#39;s really getting in  touch with accepting that energy and knowing that that is absolutely the right thing  and that you really can accept it-   <br>

Pro-

 <br> SG: Propitious.

 <br> GA: That&#39;s most propitious is eight weeks from now or eight months from now, which would put you into‚Ä¶I didn&#39;t bring my calendar.

 <br> SG: December. It&#39;s January.

 <br> GA: Or in the month of Virgo. The other thing is that a person with Venus in Virgo or with Venus in Virgo prominent in their chart, or Virgo prominent in their chart, might have a lot to do with-- affect your receptivity and your creativity. You might want to look at your cards.

 <br> SG: I have an ascendant. Virgo&#39;s ascendant. It&#39;s rising.

 <br> GA: Ah, okay. Well that might represent you. The three things here are, again, there&#39;s three here, three here, and three here, so there&#39;s nine. Very balanced. So you have nothing to do but gain from getting into receptive modes and becoming a channel for your creativity.

 <br> SG: And the source of that is more often the earth than the head?

 <br> GA: In your case, yes. If you had pulled a wand here, that&#39;s more like spiritual cosmic energy. If you had pulled a cup, it would be more emotional energy. If you had pulled a sword, that would be more of the idea and the intellectual. Because you pulled an earth, that has more to do with concrete reality, manifesting an earth energy.

Okay. Your right side, your decision-making aspect of your nature is represented here by the Nine Wands, which is strength. The wands represent intuition, spirituality, inspiration, fire. Fire is usually a symbol for purification. As your feminine creativity is represented by earth, your masculine is represented by fire. Again, it&#39;s a nine. Perfectly balanced.

 <br> SG: Really?

 <br> GA: Yes. Both of these cards have the hermit as their--

 <br> SG: Parallel. Yeah?

 <br> GA: Yes.

 <br> SG: Yeah.

 <br> GA: The time that&#39;s per‚Äì[laughs]

 <br> SG: Propitious.

 <br> GA: Propitious. [laughing]

 <br> SG: It&#39;s a wonderful word. I love it that you love it.

 <br> GA: It&#39;s again nine weeks from now or nine months from now. Usually, when it&#39;s a negative card, I&#39;ll say, okay, look back nine weeks, or nine months ago. In this case, we&#39;ll look forward.

 <br> GA: What&#39;s interesting about this card is it has both the sun, which is consciousness and awareness, and the male, in some cases, and, according to this patriarchal stuff we learned. The moon is feminine receptivity, the lunar, the night, and subconscious creativity. They&#39;re both joined by the same wand, by the same rod. This means that it&#39;s perfectly balanced in you right now. When you make your decisions and when you delegate, pass through other people, do it from a place of strength and of centeredness.

Every time you think, well, you&#39;re going to be swayed off your feet by the demands of someone, think of this card and meditate on this card. It&#39;s the sun in Sag, in Sagittarius. That means that you have to be very direct in communicating your orders, your messages. Your communication has to be very direct upfront. Sag is like aiming straight for it. So is the previous card, the Nine of Disks game. They both deal with hitting the mark and aiming directly. It&#39;s really amazing that the two sides of nature are balanced.

 <br> SG: Really? Does that say they are balanced, or that I must work on balancing, or both?

 <br> GA: I think that they are balanced but you have to maintain this balance. You have to maintain it because what you are right now doesn&#39;t mean you are tomorrow. Maybe when you meditated it cleared up a lot of stuff for you because you don&#39;t seem to have very many problems. There&#39;s flames in the background. It would symbolize inspiration, intuition. Then all the little shafts.

 <br> SG: Are they shafts or are they--

 <br> GA: They&#39;re little shafts in the arrow.

 <br> SG: Yes, right.

 <br> GA: And they&#39;re moons. The points are also moons. It just means you&#39;re a very strong lady. That strength is your mainstay. That nine months, nine weeks from now, or nine months from now, either one of those, that you might be challenged. A situation will come up to test you to see whether you&#39;re going to use strength or not. Just like over here. If you&#39;re going to be centered enough. These little tests come periodically. This is to check up on you and see if you&#39;re on your path. It could be a person, a Sagittarian person. If it doesn&#39;t happen nine weeks from now or nine months from now, it might happen during the time of Sagittarius. Usually, those times will, you&#39;ll remember them. You&#39;ll remember those events because they leave-- All these dates that I&#39;m giving you, they&#39;re going to be there. I&#39;ve not ever heard of one that hasn&#39;t been. [laughs]

 <br> SG: Trumps.

 <br> GA: The Empress. It&#39;s a trump card. Your outer environment, your outer process, the outer world is represented by the twelfth, the hanged man. Another trump. Okay, so let&#39;s take your inner. Again, they&#39;re balanced because two and one makes three.

 <br> SG: [chuckles]

 <br> GA: If you draw a card like the tower, and then you draw the chariot, they&#39;re complements of each other. Because six and one makes seven. There are cycles in the tarot, numerologically, in astrology, astrologically, there are definite cycles, and this is one cycle. Okay, what you don&#39;t deal with in your Empress energy or year comes up in your hanged man year. Everybody goes through a growth year every year. Jane is going through the 10‚ÄìWhat was it that I told you, the Wheel of Fortune?

 <br> SG: mmhmm

 <br> GA: The growth year that you&#39;re going through with-- Okay. Okay, you&#39;re going through a two-year, the High Priestess, which is another lesbian card.

 <br> SG: mmhmm

 <br> GA: In your growth year, what you&#39;re trying to do is you&#39;re trying to balance your independence. People are making demands on you, and they&#39;re not giving you your space. The tendency during that year is to either walk out, withdraw, leave. It&#39;s either withdraw or leave. A lot of times you probably are gonna feel like doing that. Yes. Also, it&#39;s a year where you get in touch with your intuition and your receptivity.

 <br> SG: When is that? This, this‚Äî

 <br> GA: This growth year that you started in, at the time of your birthday, it&#39;s going to go from--

The karma for that year, the two karma, which is my karma, is being attentive to detail, being of service to others, being organized, efficient, and all the things I&#39;m not. [laughs] It&#39;s my karma.

 <br> SG: You&#39;re kidding.

 <br> GA: That&#39;s the year you&#39;re going to have to get on top of that. How much time can you allow? Okay, and here&#39;s where the Empress comes in. The Empress is the card, the energy that says, okay, how much am I going to put out? How much am I going to take in? It&#39;s the card of giving and receiving. If you overextend, you get in this position, the hangman. If you underextend, the same thing happens. The thing to look for is your love nature. When you give, are you giving out of the goodness of your heart and out of altruistic feelings? Or are you giving like a bargaining, like a merchandising? I&#39;ll give you this much if you give me this much. I will love you this much if you love me this much. This is to watch it. You don&#39;t make love to a bargain or merchandise. The Empress is the card of symbolizing the fertility of nature. He comes into you. She&#39;s sort of like Venus, Aphrodite, that image, love, but also harmony and balance. Let me see. Nurturing. A lot of nurturing. See the little birds down there?

 <br> SG: Yes.

 <br> GA: Do you think that&#39;s a pelican?

 <br> SG: I&#39;m not sure, it could be I think. It doesn&#39;t have a lot of--

 <br> GA: The symbol for the pelican was the mother cutting open her breast to feed her little bird&#39;s blood. It was like this nurturing, almost like. You&#39;ve got to be careful when you get into nurturing.

 <br> SG: That&#39;s very good advice. Very good.

 <br> GA: A lot of green. The green is like fertility, creativity. There are a lot of magnetic lines. Magnetic lines are curved, feminine. Vertical lines are more aggressive, more masculine, dynamic. My teacher Angie Arrien doesn&#39;t like to use feminine and masculine, so she uses dynamic and magnetic. It&#39;s the same truth.

 <br> SG: Dynamic is the masculine thing? isn&#39;t that interesting.

 <br> GA: Just a lot of curved lines. Look at the way she holds her arms.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#88C9F2" data-initial-bg-color="#88C9F2" data-tags="Empress"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Empress</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:15:36</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> <br> SG: I&#39;m eating all your sunflower seeds.

 <br> GA: The number two karma?

 <br> SG: Yes, right, all that. Yes.

 <br> GA: There&#39;s like moon, the crescent moon, symbolizing the feminine.

 <br> SG: And the business of watching my sacrificial energy.

 <br> GA: Yes.

 <br> SG: Good.

This is the hanged man. Okay, my interpretation of the hanged man is not really the traditional kind. The traditional kind is being fixed and tied and all that to a certain position, which is, in my interpretation, that can happen. But if you look at the card, the man is upside down. There&#39;s a snake here. See the eye? It looks like asleep. Unmoving. The man has no hair, and the eyes seem closed. Okay, when a baby doesn&#39;t understand something, a lot of times he&#39;ll get on his hands and knees and look between his legs. This is what you have to do. You have to turn your perspective upside down.

In your environment with the people in your office and people you relate with, what you have to do is you have to turn the situation around. You have to look at it with new eyes, from a new perspective. Instead of thinking, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m fixed, I&#39;m tied.&quot; I see that you have the potential to awaken the snake, regenerate, transform it. In order to do that, you have to give up your old point of view, and that&#39;s the sacrifice. You have to give up your stance and the way you perceive things, and just totally let go of that perception. Turn your head around and look from a different view, and see if you can solve the problem by that. That&#39;s basically--

 <br> SG: Is this ocean up here? What is this up here?

 <br> GA: That&#39;s the symbol for wisdom.

 <br> SG: The blue?

 <br> GA: Yes.

 <br> SG: huh‚Ä¶

 <br> GA: The blue in most color symbology represents wisdom, serenity. That there&#39;s that in you, that potentiality. Then all these little grid things--

 <br> SG: What is that? Yeah‚Ä¶

 <br> GA: It means that-- This kind of grid is like foundations for buildings for making things. Sometimes before they put--

 <br> SG: Concrete.

 <br> GA: Yes. Okay, so this just means that it&#39;s up to you as to what you fill in, what you create, that the thing to hang you up is your perception.

 <br> SG: That&#39;s the perception here.

This is what that card is about. You&#39;ve got to give up your stance and your worldview right now, whatever it is. It&#39;s a sacrifice. Say you have two potentialities. One, to write a book on spirituality, and the other one to be a very good school administrator or whatever. Okay. In order to do--

You&#39;re this tree and you have these two branches. In order for one to flower and blossom, you&#39;re going to have to cut back the other. It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re going to kill the tree. It just means you&#39;re going to prune. This is the card. What are you going to sacrifice? What branch are you going to? You need to look at your life. This is going to be demanded of you in about 12 weeks. You have between now and 12 weeks.

 <br> SG: You&#39;re just about right. That would be about the middle of August?

 <br> GA: mmhmm

 <br> SG: That&#39;s when school starts.

 <br> GA: mmhmm. You have to give up something.

 <br> SG: sighs

 <br> GA: I think that the answer might lie in how much you&#39;re willing to nurture and give, and how much you&#39;re willing to receive. Do you want that to be balanced? If you are going to give to these people, are you going to resent it?

I think I&#39;ll do these 2 and then the 7.

 <br> SG: Okay

 <br> GA: This is your test card, your lesson. It&#39;s the Ten of Swords Ruin. In 10 weeks, you need to get rid of this pattern. So what you do-- Let me tell you about the pattern first. This is the Sun in Gemini. In Gemini&#39;s communication in the twins which is very close to the lovers, being pulled in opposite directions. Sun is just awareness. Here you have all these swords. There&#39;s 9. I&#39;ve never been able to find the 10th sword in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The swords represent thoughts. Your thoughts are piercing your heart. They&#39;re wounding your heart. See the little heart there? With thoughts of ruin, of self-ruin. That has to do with communicating something. Consciously dealing with something. It has to do with the Sun in Gemini. It means that 10 years ago or 10 weeks ago, you were wounded. Probably by somebody else, but you took it up and you beat yourself with it. Situations come up where you think, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s no use. It&#39;s futile. It doesn&#39;t do any good.&quot; You do this thought number on yourself.

If you just will recognize it, that it is just your thoughts. That it is one aspect of yourself and not all of yourself. The hourglass, there&#39;s hourglasses here. There&#39;s sigils, S-I-G-I-L. They&#39;re upside down. Over here is the scales on top. Those are symbols that are pretty much self-explanatory. The hourglass has to do with time. Time running out. You putting a thing on yourself because you didn&#39;t do this in time or you didn&#39;t do that in time. The scales are like justice and balance and money. It also has to do with money. It&#39;s a very simple card. It just means thoughts of self-ruin.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#B3B3E6" data-initial-bg-color="#B3B3E6" data-tags="Zodiac"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Zodiac</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:25:00</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> <br> SG: Could it be guilt? Is there any guilt in that card? I&#39;m having a hard time applying it. Everything else is fitting really very nicely. Could that be an unexpected turn?

 <br> GA: I think that the test for you is going to have to be it&#39;s sort of like, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s guilt. It&#39;s guilt. The guilt that&#39;s in it has to do with that you&#39;re feeling bad for doing this trip on yourself and then you feel guilty that you should know better than to have these thoughts and entertain these thoughts. The way I see it is just a lot of these thoughts clashing which are symbolized by the broken sword hands and contradictory which is Gemini. The sign of Gemini can be very contradictory. Just like contradictory clashing thoughts in your head and that you might think that you should be able to ward them off or handle them. Sometimes they just get to be too much. It&#39;s not a card that I know a whole lot about because it doesn&#39;t come up that often. The only thing I can go by are--

 <br> SG: It&#39;s a warning I think.

 <br> GA: yeah

 <br> SG: I think it&#39;s a warning.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#99E6FF" data-initial-bg-color="#99E6FF" data-tags="Disks,Swords"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Disks</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Swords</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:26:38</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%"> <br> GA: That your breakthrough will come from you letting these thoughts come and not giving them too much energy. It&#39;s like when you meditate and you&#39;re concentrating on your breath or your mantra, these thoughts come but you don&#39;t beat yourself over the head because you can&#39;t concentrate or you can&#39;t meditate. You just let them come and flow out. Don&#39;t give them any mind. Don&#39;t give them any energy. That is going to be the test.

 <br> SG: Ah I think I--okay‚Ä¶

 <br> GA: Does that make sense to you? Because if you get on the other side then it&#39;s rebirth and transformation. The rebirth and transformation that were realized by the Princess of Disks and the Queen of Disks. That when you come through this pattern, when you let go of this pattern then the rest will follow through. Because it&#39;s your lesson card. A lot of times it&#39;s a card to show if you&#39;re off your path. The negative cards, there&#39;s a cycle to them. They begin with the Three of Swords. Sorrow. Very early in life, we experience grief because of temper tantrums because we can&#39;t get things the way we want them. Usually when we&#39;re around three years old. You&#39;re not getting the attention. You&#39;re not getting this. You&#39;re not getting that. I&#39;m going to answer that because I think it&#39;s--

 <br> SG: okay good.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent border-t-8 border-t-gray overflow-hidden after:shadow after:absolute after:content-[&quot;&quot;]"></div>  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#000000" data-initial-bg-color="#000000" data-tags=""> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  </div><div class="annotation-band h-full basis-3 group border-r-2 border-white flex-shrink-0 grow" style="background-color:#ADFFD9" data-initial-bg-color="#ADFFD9" data-tags="Swords,Cups,Disks"> <!-- only show the popup if the annotation has tags in the selected category -->  <div class="annotation-band-popup hidden group-hover:block w-96 absolute"> <div class="shadow bg-white"> <div class="p-2" style="background-color:#99AFF2"> Astrological And Tarot Symbols </div> <div class="p-2 flex flex-col gap-4"> <div class="flex flex-wrap gap-4 w-full"> <div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Swords</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Cups</span></div><div class="bg-gray-200 tag-pill rounded-full text-xs flex flex-row justify-center px-3 py-1.5 gap-1 cursor-default "><span class="font-semibold">Disks</span></div> </div> <p class="text-sm">00:28:29</p> <div class="max-h-32 overflow-y-auto text-sm"> <div> <div class="[overflow-wrap:anywhere]">  <p class="min-h-6 leading-6" style="font-size:16px;font-weight:normal;line-height:150%">[recording stops and restarts immediately]

 <br> GA: Okay, so your breakthrough will come through dealing with the fear of ruin. It&#39;s actually fear of ruin.

 <br> SG: Did you turn that on?

 <br> GA: Let&#39;s see.

 <br> SG: okay okay

 <br> GA: It&#39;s actually fear of ruin rather than ruin itself. In this case, it has to do with your creativity. I think it has to do with, I don&#39;t think it has to do with Jane because all the cards were pretty good and they were all high cards. It might have to do with your work aspect. Whether you can balance this life between work and creativity and that you feel the fear about maybe you&#39;re not doing that, not balancing because there&#39;s a Libra of scales. It&#39;s this fear.

 <br> SG: That&#39;s good. That helps.

 <br> GA: Anyway to get back to the sword, the three of sorrows is the first card in the negative cycle. There&#39;s a progression and they go from swords, cups, wands, and then disks. Most traditional Tarotists, people that read Tarot, they don&#39;t have that progression. To me it&#39;s the creation, the idea is first thought out. Then it&#39;s felt, your emotions get engaged and then you start working on your intuition and the wants and then you bring it to Earth with the disks and that&#39;s the progression that I use. First in the head then in the emotion.

 <br> SG: Then, the intuition?

 <br> GA: Intuition and then-

 <br> SG: Ground?

 <br> GA: -you manifest it in reality and so this is yet very early. You could nip it in the bud, you know? It&#39;s when you get a negative disc that you&#39;ve gone through all of these repeated--

 <br> SG: Yeah, yeah.

 <br> GA: You&#39;ve gone through strife and disappointment, the five of cups and you&#39;re going through defeat. The five of swords and you&#39;re going, all of these, and there&#39;s only 13 negative cards in this deck and you only got one out of 2, 4, 6, 8, out of 10, so that&#39;s pretty good.

Turn it over?

 <br> Gloria Anzaldua: Yes. That represents your interaction with Jane. Turn that over. Oh, this represents how you see Jane. This card represents her. This is great. This represents your karmic link or why you came together, what you have to learn from each other. They&#39;re beautiful. This represents your career and creativity, the receptivity. Beautiful. This is your decision-making processes, delegating duties and all that. God, you don&#39;t have any problems in that respect. The inner environmental process and the outer.

 <br> SG: Turn this one over?

 <br> GA: It doesn&#39;t really matter. In this case reverse just means that there&#39;s a greater focus on the card. It&#39;s beautiful. This is your outer environment you work with. This represents yourself, your total self in relation to all these questions and who you are and how you see yourself. Beautiful. This is your test, your lesson. What you need to breakthrough or--

 <br> SG: With swords! Ten!

 <br> GA: That&#39;s one negative card out of the whole bunch. Now the last one is the outcome card. Wow. First of all a general look at the cards, you have one, two, three, four, five trump cards. That&#39;s very unusual. Trump cards are gifts to you. Even the hangmen their energies had come to you. The royalty you have, one, two, three. The royalties are the cards that represent actually doing and acting on things. The minor arcana are potentials. Things that you can act on. These people really act on them. The queens and the princesses or defenders. The frontal people they face you, they defend. The knights and the princesses are hunters, the more aggressive kind. In your deck there are knights in the Waite deck but there&#39;re not any princesses.

 <br> SG: That&#39;s right.

 <br> GA: There&#39;re just kings, so you have to make the transition. The negative card represents thoughts or self-rule, that what you do is, you do a mental trip on yourself. The outcome card is the card of synthesis of arcana.

This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there&#39;s a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she&#39;s looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She&#39;s looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from. She is the only one in the royalty cards that looks towards the past.

 <br> SG: Is that right?

 <br> GA: Ah-ha. The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it&#39;s a process of expanding consciously in your head.

She represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it&#39;s a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.

The vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?

 <br> SG: mmhmm! I realize that.

 <br> GA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you&#39;re going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She&#39;s wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what&#39;s going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet. She&#39;s like real centered, content, she knows what she wants, she knows herself and she&#39;s just like emotionally there.

 <br> SG: Good! Good.

 <br> GA: Basically the message is to do something aesthetically pleasing about your surroundings and take care of your health and also maybe go out and buy a dress or cut your hair. It&#39;s a card that says it&#39;s time to beautify your-- or get something for her to do that. Do you have any questions about this card?

There&#39;ll be a child that will trigger that in her, of owning her childlike innocence and playfulness.

 <br> The child will represent Horace, like the father represented Osiris. Isis in this picture is a contemporary woman. The man was older, the child was younger. Isis is a contemporary woman and someone that&#39;s close to her age. This woman will open up vistas in the occult, in maybe tarot or the i ching, or maybe a reading that she had. Some psychic thing will be mirrored to her by a contemporary woman who&#39;s into the occult, or into the mysteries, or spirituality. When she recognizes that woman, then it&#39;s like recognizing her potential to get into the occult and her inner spirituality.

 <br> GA: Yes.

 <br> SG: Not when we met, but when we--

 <br> GA: When you--?

 <br> SG: When we first really got together in any kind of a sexual way.

There&#39;s three Earths, Virgo, Taurus, and Capricorn, and of those three, the Taurus is the sign that really does manifest things.

 <br> SG: It&#39;s fixed.

 <br> GA: Fixed. So that she&#39;s got that potential. The elephant. See the elephant over here? The elephant--

 <br> SG: hah. Two of them. Is it two? Yes.

 <br> GA: Yes. They had to do with hearing. With a sense of hearing. A symbol for that and also for long memories. These snails here. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, means that she&#39;s been pierced by five. How many did I say?

 <br> SG: Nine.

 <br> GA: By nine situation, people, events, whatever, that have been very instrumental in transformations for her and breakthroughs. The snake represents regeneration and rebirth. These memories of our experiences or lessons, whatever they are, she has the ability to go through them and be transformed. The symbol of the snake. The dove is the symbol of wisdom, peace. Wisdom if the little bird is carrying an olive twig. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an olive twig here, so this is just peace and love. This thing in the background. One, two, three, four, five, it just represents all of the perceptions, mental, emotional, spiritual. And the key?

 <br> SG: mmhmm

 <br> GA: represents the key to knowledge, to the wisdom that you, through a teaching learning situation you can acquire. Then also bringing to earth, the two fingers. The orange color is the second chakra color, which is healing. It&#39;s the color of healing. Healing and renewal. There&#39;s also some red, which is a lot of energy, fashion. Isis is holding a bow in her hand, and it&#39;s the crescent moon. That&#39;s symbolizes the unconscious, the subconscious.

 <br> SG: I had thought of the Hierophant as being a very disciplined, ordered card, at least from the Waite deck. That&#39;s what is represented in the social orders, social hierarchies. This reading is very different. That&#39;s good.

 <br> GA: I can&#39;t think of anything else to add.

 <br> SG: With Jane. Together?

 <br> GA: Yeah. This is the pregnant lady in the deck. She is the princess of disks. She has gone, walked up the top of the mountain, gone through the briar patch. All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You&#39;re in the clear. You&#39;re out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you&#39;ve gone through. That the both of you have gone through. Again, the Aries, moving forward, the Aries horns, the ram horns, moving forward with awareness.

 <br> There&#39;s a snake, and she&#39;s carrying it on her shoulders, and it looks like a cloak and it&#39;s asleep. She&#39;s near getting ready to do this transformation, to give birth to a new identity. Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn&#39;t been able to be with her, because you&#39;ve worked through all these things.

 <br> The long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It&#39;s sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I&#39;m loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.

 <br> The other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she&#39;s touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She&#39;s holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it&#39;s horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.&quot;

 <br> SG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?

 <br> GA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it&#39;s inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you&#39;ve got things in control. You&#39;ve got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It&#39;s the earth symbol. She&#39;s a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She&#39;s sort of like three-dimensional. I don&#39;t know.

 <br> SG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What&#39;s the background Gloria?

 <br> GA: Would you like some--?

 <br> SG: Yes, I would love. What&#39;s the background? Is it mountains?

 <br> GA: Yes, she&#39;s walked through the mountains. It&#39;s been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She&#39;s gone through the dark forest.

 <br> SG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she&#39;s got there?

 <br> GA: That&#39;s part of the snake.

 <br> SG: Is that still a snake?

 <br> GA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you&#39;re going to give birth to a project that&#39;s financially rewarding, or you&#39;re going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I&#39;m not sure.

 <br> SG: That&#39;s good. For sure it&#39;s not financial. [laughs] I don&#39;t see that at all. It must be the other.

 <br> GA: Yes. She looks a little tired. It&#39;s been a long haul.

Am I taking too long?

 <br> GA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It&#39;s ruled by-- It&#39;s a card of Libra, I&#39;m Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren&#39;t lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley&#39;s relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.

There&#39;s a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.

This card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It&#39;s a very-- If you look at it carefully, there&#39;s a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that&#39;s how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You&#39;re very much able to do it.

If you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it&#39;s called. To do this, you need to take into account your love nature, the Venus aspect that the way you relate to people and the way you-- Como se dice? You cannot divorce your personal--</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block annotation-band-popup-arrow absolute w-0 h-0 border-x-8 border-x-transparent

Lieberman suggests it is most likely an endocrine or hormonal imbalance at play, reminding Anzald√∫a she&#39;s been well-protected. Lieberman tells Anzald√∫a her pride has caused her to have pent-up anger; Anzald√∫a agrees. Lieberman recommends finding many outlets to release excess anger and to stay healthy. She reminds Anzald√∫a to meet her own needs, rather than to satisfy the expectations of others.</p>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="hidden group-hover:block
