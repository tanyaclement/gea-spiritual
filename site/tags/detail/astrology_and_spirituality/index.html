Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there&#39;s a smooth connection between things, or they&#39;ll clash. 

                 <br>                 Gloria Anzaldúa: That&#39;s what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Right. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : People use that. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : That&#39;s a lousy way to put it because it&#39;s not a matter of bad. There&#39;s  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. 

                 <br>                 Also, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it&#39;s probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. 

                 <br>                 Conjunction is neutral, although it&#39;s a very powerful aspect, it&#39;s not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don&#39;t like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I&#39;ve seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn&#39;t work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. 

                 <br>                 Things come so easy that it&#39;s hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you&#39;re not challenged. You don&#39;t run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it&#39;s like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : That makes sense.

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Right, and also the sparks, the clash.

Anyway, that&#39;s basically-- There&#39;s also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Like my Sun and Mars.

When I say it&#39;s neutral, that&#39;s the most neutral of the aspects, in that it&#39;s a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, &quot;&quot;This is what I want,&quot;&quot; and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people&#39;s needs  sometimes.

It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then--

When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It&#39;s not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it&#39;s not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There&#39;s something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They&#39;re different for the different aspects, and they&#39;re also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it&#39;s one of the  inner planets, it&#39;s one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It&#39;s too past Saturn and Mars as one. 

                 <br>                 This side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it&#39;s with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it&#39;s inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don&#39;t know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.

                 <br>                 How that goes into your sun, is first of all, that&#39;s really connected to your sense of  self. There&#39;s two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it&#39;s generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : Well, I better start developing. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, it&#39;s there. When you&#39;re looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it&#39;s different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It&#39;s the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It&#39;s in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I&#39;ve done drugs. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, it&#39;s a drug thing. It&#39;s such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. 

                 <br>         <strong>        GA        </strong>        : I think I do that too. 

                 <br>         <strong>        LB        </strong>        : Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto&#39;s type spirituality is a very different- - It&#39;s much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It&#39;s more occult, it&#39;s more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over.

For example, I&#39;m a double lover, but in my numerology, I have two double sevens and a double nine, the hermit and chariot. Sometimes people are in a growth year that is erected to this card. The number five, or that five years ago, something happened between the two of you.

                 <br>                 SG: It was our-- Yes, exactly [laughs]. That&#39;s wonderful. That&#39;s very fun. Very fun.

                 <br>                 GA: What I want to do is, I want to figure out what her growth year is. It&#39;s amazing. Two lovers living together, double lovers. It works, huh?

                 <br>                 SG: Actually, we don&#39;t live together.

                 <br>                 SG: With Jane. Together?

                 <br>                 GA: Yeah. This is the pregnant lady in the deck. She is the princess of disks. She has gone, walked up the top of the mountain, gone through the briar patch. All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You&#39;re in the clear. You&#39;re out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you&#39;ve gone through. That the both of you have gone through. Again, the Aries, moving forward, the Aries horns, the ram horns, moving forward with awareness.

                 <br>                 There&#39;s a snake, and she&#39;s carrying it on her shoulders, and it looks like a cloak and it&#39;s asleep. She&#39;s near getting ready to do this transformation, to give birth to a new identity. Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn&#39;t been able to be with her, because you&#39;ve worked through all these things.

                 <br>                 The long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It&#39;s sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I&#39;m loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.

                 <br>                 The other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she&#39;s touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She&#39;s holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it&#39;s horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.&quot;

                 <br>                 SG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?

                 <br>                 GA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it&#39;s inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you&#39;ve got things in control. You&#39;ve got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It&#39;s the earth symbol. She&#39;s a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She&#39;s sort of like three-dimensional. I don&#39;t know.

                 <br>                 SG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What&#39;s the background Gloria?

                 <br>                 GA: Would you like some--?

                 <br>                 SG: Yes, I would love. What&#39;s the background? Is it mountains?

                 <br>                 GA: Yes, she&#39;s walked through the mountains. It&#39;s been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She&#39;s gone through the dark forest.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she&#39;s got there?

                 <br>                 GA: That&#39;s part of the snake.

                 <br>                 SG: Is that still a snake?

                 <br>                 GA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you&#39;re going to give birth to a project that&#39;s financially rewarding, or you&#39;re going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I&#39;m not sure.

                 <br>                 SG: That&#39;s good. For sure it&#39;s not financial. [laughs] I don&#39;t see that at all. It must be the other.

                 <br>                 GA: Yes. She looks a little tired. It&#39;s been a long haul.

                 <br>                 SG: Mm-hmm.
