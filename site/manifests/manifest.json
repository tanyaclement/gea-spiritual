This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there's a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she's looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She's looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from. She is the only one in the royalty cards that looks towards the past.\n\n\n\nSG: Is that right?\n\n\n\nGA: Ah-ha. The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it's a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?\n\n\n\nSG: mmhmm! I realize that.\n\n\n\nGA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you're going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She's wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what's going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet. She's like real centered, content, she knows what she wants, she knows herself and she's just like emotionally there.\n\n\n\nSG: Good!

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\n\n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right. \n\n\n\nGA\n: People use that. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\n\n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\n\n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: That makes sense.\n\n\n\nLB\n: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\n\n\nGA\n: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\n\n\nGA\n: They're both necessary. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

She's a very good astrologer. She's a Sag with a moon in Pisces. She's a lovely person, and she's really good. She teaches here and there. She's good. I would recommend her, because I'm not doing it. I have evenings where I get into it. I sat down and gave Meg and Julia an astrology class for two hours one morning. It was really fun.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Did they like that?\n\n\n\nLB\n: Yeah, they loved it. [unintelligible 00:14:41] Anyway, in the astrology class we were talking about the different ages. You know that term of going into the age of Aquarius? Each one is 2,000 years long. We were talking about that-- and they go backwards. It's the age we're in is Pisces now, going to Aquarius, and before that was Aries and before that was Taurus. It's interesting in terms of when you think about-- The Arian age was Greek and Roman, the barbarians and everybody killing everybody, else which is very Aries stuff, the age of the heroes. Then Pisces is the age of the martyrs. We were thinking about all this stuff.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes. Taurus astrologically would make sense.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\n\n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right. \n\n\n\nGA\n: People use that. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\n\n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\n\n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: That makes sense.\n\n\n\nLB\n: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\n\n\nGA\n: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\n\n\nGA\n: They're both necessary. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\n\n\nLB\n: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\n\n\nGA\n: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\n\n\nLB\n: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\n\n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right. \n\n\n\nGA\n: People use that. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\n\n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\n\n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: That makes sense.\n\n\n\nLB\n: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\n\n\nGA\n: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\n\n\nGA\n: They're both necessary. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\n\n\nLB\n: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\n\n\nGA\n: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\n\n\nLB\n: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2#t=90,320"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2/page3","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2#t=90,90"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2/page3","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA\n: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher.

Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\n\n\nLB\n: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\n\n\nGA\n: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\n\n\nLB\n: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA\n: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\n\n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right. \n\n\n\nGA\n: People use that. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\n\n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\n\n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: That makes sense.\n\n\n\nLB\n: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\n\n\nGA\n: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\n\n\nGA\n: They're both necessary. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\n\n\nLB\n: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\n\n\nGA\n: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\n\n\nLB\n: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

She's a very good astrologer. She's a Sag with a moon in Pisces. She's a lovely person, and she's really good. She teaches here and there. She's good. I would recommend her, because I'm not doing it. I have evenings where I get into it. I sat down and gave Meg and Julia an astrology class for two hours one morning. It was really fun.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Did they like that?\n\n\n\nLB\n: Yeah, they loved it. [unintelligible 00:14:41] Anyway, in the astrology class we were talking about the different ages. You know that term of going into the age of Aquarius? Each one is 2,000 years long. We were talking about that-- and they go backwards. It's the age we're in is Pisces now, going to Aquarius, and before that was Aries and before that was Taurus. It's interesting in terms of when you think about-- The Arian age was Greek and Roman, the barbarians and everybody killing everybody, else which is very Aries stuff, the age of the heroes. Then Pisces is the age of the martyrs. We were thinking about all this stuff.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes. Taurus astrologically would make sense.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\n\n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right. \n\n\n\nGA\n: People use that. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\n\n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\n\n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: That makes sense.\n\n\n\nLB\n: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\n\n\nGA\n: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\n\n\nGA\n: They're both necessary. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\n\n\nLB\n: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\n\n\nGA\n: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\n\n\nLB\n: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\n\n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right. \n\n\n\nGA\n: People use that. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\n\n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\n\n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: That makes sense.\n\n\n\nLB\n: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\n\n\nGA\n: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\n\n\nGA\n: They're both necessary. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\n\n\nLB\n: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\n\n\nGA\n: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\n\n\nLB\n: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/2/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA\n: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged.

When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects.

Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\n\n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right. \n\n\n\nGA\n: People use that. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\n\n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\n\n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\n\n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: That makes sense.\n\n\n\nLB\n: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\n\n\nGA\n: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\n\n\nGA\n: They're both necessary. \n\n\n\nLB\n: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\n\n\nLB\n: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\n\n\nGA\n: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\n\n\nLB\n: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\n\n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\n\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\n\n\nGA\n: Well, I better start developing. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I've done drugs. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\n\n\nGA\n: I think I do that too. \n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

See it looks like one towards the end of your life that’s that’s a marriage it looks pretty good, and then another one in the middle of your life that looks…that’s all there already in marked in your hand.\n\n\n\nGA:\n hmm…Wow\n\n\n\nCS:\n This one in the end of your life looks like it’s a real positive, \"up\" relationship, and the other one looks like you go through a lot of shit together.\n\n\n\nGA:\n Yeah, I think this line must be me and Randy. We had real hard times. This one. I don’t know who the other one is.\n\n\n\nCS:\n You haven’t met them yet.\n\n\n\nGA:\n So there’s only two lines?\n\n\n\nCS:\n Well, there could be more coming in.

They’re not good enough to discern which things mean stuff and which things don’t.
