It's the sun in Sag, in Sagittarius. That means that you have to be very direct in communicating your orders, your messages. Your communication has to be very direct upfront. Sag is like aiming straight for it. So is the previous card, the Nine of Disks game. They both deal with hitting the mark and aiming directly. It's really amazing that the two sides of nature are balanced.\n\nSG: Really? Does that say they are balanced, or that I must work on balancing, or both?\n\nGA: I think that they are balanced but you have to maintain this balance. You have to maintain it because what you are right now doesn't mean you are tomorrow. Maybe when you meditated it cleared up a lot of stuff for you because you don't seem to have very many problems.

So what you do-- Let me tell you about the pattern first. This is the Sun in Gemini. In Gemini's communication in the twins which is very close to the lovers, being pulled in opposite directions. Sun is just awareness. Here you have all these swords. There's 9. I've never been able to find the 10th sword in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe swords represent thoughts. Your thoughts are piercing your heart. They're wounding your heart. See the little heart there? With thoughts of ruin, of self-ruin. That has to do with communicating something. Consciously dealing with something. It has to do with the Sun in Gemini. It means that 10 years ago or 10 weeks ago, you were wounded. Probably by somebody else, but you took it up and you beat yourself with it. Situations come up where you think, \"Oh, it's no use. It's futile. It doesn't do any good.\" You do this thought number on yourself.\n\nIf you just will recognize it, that it is just your thoughts. That it is one aspect of yourself and not all of yourself. The hourglass, there's hourglasses here. There's sigils, S-I-G-I-L. They're upside down. Over here is the scales on top. Those are symbols that are pretty much self-explanatory. The hourglass has to do with time. Time running out. You putting a thing on yourself because you didn't do this in time or you didn't do that in time. The scales are like justice and balance and money. It also has to do with money. It's a very simple card.

The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it's a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?\n\nSG: mmhmm! I realize that.\n\nGA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you're going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She's wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what's going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet. She's like real centered, content, she knows what she wants, she knows herself and she's just like emotionally there.\n\nSG: Good! Good.\n\nGA: Basically the message is to do something aesthetically pleasing about your surroundings and take care of your health and also maybe go out and buy a dress or cut your hair. It's a card that says it's time to beautify your-- or get something for her to do that. Do you have any questions about this card?\n\nSG: No. That's a terrific reading.

The moon is feminine receptivity, the lunar, the night, and subconscious creativity. They're both joined by the same wand, by the same rod. This means that it's perfectly balanced in you right now. When you make your decisions and when you delegate, pass through other people, do it from a place of strength and of centeredness.\n\nEvery time you think, well, you're going to be swayed off your feet by the demands of someone, think of this card and meditate on this card. It's the sun in Sag, in Sagittarius. That means that you have to be very direct in communicating your orders, your messages. Your communication has to be very direct upfront. Sag is like aiming straight for it. So is the previous card, the Nine of Disks game. They both deal with hitting the mark and aiming directly. It's really amazing that the two sides of nature are balanced.\n\nSG: Really? Does that say they are balanced, or that I must work on balancing, or both?\n\nGA: I think that they are balanced but you have to maintain this balance. You have to maintain it because what you are right now doesn't mean you are tomorrow. Maybe when you meditated it cleared up a lot of stuff for you because you don't seem to have very many problems.

So what you do-- Let me tell you about the pattern first. This is the Sun in Gemini. In Gemini's communication in the twins which is very close to the lovers, being pulled in opposite directions. Sun is just awareness. Here you have all these swords. There's 9. I've never been able to find the 10th sword in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe swords represent thoughts. Your thoughts are piercing your heart. They're wounding your heart. See the little heart there? With thoughts of ruin, of self-ruin. That has to do with communicating something. Consciously dealing with something. It has to do with the Sun in Gemini. It means that 10 years ago or 10 weeks ago, you were wounded. Probably by somebody else, but you took it up and you beat yourself with it. Situations come up where you think, \"Oh, it's no use. It's futile. It doesn't do any good.\" You do this thought number on yourself.\n\nIf you just will recognize it, that it is just your thoughts. That it is one aspect of yourself and not all of yourself. The hourglass, there's hourglasses here. There's sigils, S-I-G-I-L. They're upside down. Over here is the scales on top. Those are symbols that are pretty much self-explanatory. The hourglass has to do with time. Time running out. You putting a thing on yourself because you didn't do this in time or you didn't do that in time. The scales are like justice and balance and money. It also has to do with money. It's a very simple card.

To me it's the creation, the idea is first thought out.

She is ruled by Aries, and there's a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out.

The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it's a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility.

All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You're in the clear. You're out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you've gone through. That the both of you have gone through.

Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She's holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand.

Vertical means inner.\"\n\nSG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?\n\nGA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it's inside both of you, since both of you make the link.

Is all that still the cloak that she's got there?\n\nGA: That's part of the snake.\n\nSG: Is that still a snake?\n\nGA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers.

Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley's relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley.

It's the sun in Sag, in Sagittarius. That means that you have to be very direct in communicating your orders, your messages. Your communication has to be very direct upfront.

It's really amazing that the two sides of nature are balanced.\n\nSG: Really? Does that say they are balanced, or that I must work on balancing, or both?\n\nGA: I think that they are balanced but you have to maintain this balance. You have to maintain it because what you are right now doesn't mean you are tomorrow. Maybe when you meditated it cleared up a lot of stuff for you because you don't seem to have very many problems.

So what you do-- Let me tell you about the pattern first. This is the Sun in Gemini. In Gemini's communication in the twins which is very close to the lovers, being pulled in opposite directions. Sun is just awareness. Here you have all these swords. There's 9. I've never been able to find the 10th sword in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe swords represent thoughts. Your thoughts are piercing your heart. They're wounding your heart. See the little heart there? With thoughts of ruin, of self-ruin. That has to do with communicating something. Consciously dealing with something. It has to do with the Sun in Gemini. It means that 10 years ago or 10 weeks ago, you were wounded. Probably by somebody else, but you took it up and you beat yourself with it. Situations come up where you think, \"Oh, it's no use. It's futile. It doesn't do any good.\" You do this thought number on yourself.\n\nIf you just will recognize it, that it is just your thoughts. That it is one aspect of yourself and not all of yourself. The hourglass, there's hourglasses here. There's sigils, S-I-G-I-L. They're upside down. Over here is the scales on top. Those are symbols that are pretty much self-explanatory. The hourglass has to do with time. Time running out. You putting a thing on yourself because you didn't do this in time or you didn't do that in time. The scales are like justice and balance and money. It also has to do with money. It's a very simple card.

She is ruled by Aries, and there's a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out.

The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it's a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility.

All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You're in the clear. You're out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you've gone through. That the both of you have gone through.

Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She's holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand.

Vertical means inner.\"\n\nSG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?\n\nGA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it's inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you've got things in control. You've got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance.

Is all that still the cloak that she's got there?\n\nGA: That's part of the snake.\n\nSG: Is that still a snake?\n\nGA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you're going to give birth to a project that's financially rewarding, or you're going to give birth to a new identity.

She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren't lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley's relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley.

You have to maintain it because what you are right now doesn't mean you are tomorrow. Maybe when you meditated it cleared up a lot of stuff for you because you don't seem to have very many problems.

So what you do-- Let me tell you about the pattern first. This is the Sun in Gemini. In Gemini's communication in the twins which is very close to the lovers, being pulled in opposite directions. Sun is just awareness. Here you have all these swords. There's 9. I've never been able to find the 10th sword in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe swords represent thoughts. Your thoughts are piercing your heart. They're wounding your heart. See the little heart there? With thoughts of ruin, of self-ruin. That has to do with communicating something. Consciously dealing with something. It has to do with the Sun in Gemini. It means that 10 years ago or 10 weeks ago, you were wounded. Probably by somebody else, but you took it up and you beat yourself with it. Situations come up where you think, \"Oh, it's no use. It's futile. It doesn't do any good.\" You do this thought number on yourself.\n\nIf you just will recognize it, that it is just your thoughts. That it is one aspect of yourself and not all of yourself. The hourglass, there's hourglasses here. There's sigils, S-I-G-I-L. They're upside down. Over here is the scales on top. Those are symbols that are pretty much self-explanatory. The hourglass has to do with time. Time running out. You putting a thing on yourself because you didn't do this in time or you didn't do that in time. The scales are like justice and balance and money. It also has to do with money. It's a very simple card.

To me it's the creation, the idea is first thought out.

She is ruled by Aries, and there's a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out.

The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it's a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility.

All those are obstacles that she has left behind, so that in your relationship, with obstacles, unresolved karma, whatever it was that you had to do together, you have done pretty much. You're in the clear. You're out of the woods, so to speak. The briars, the branches, those represent obstacles that you've gone through. That the both of you have gone through.

Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She's holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand.

Vertical means inner.\"\n\nSG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?\n\nGA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it's inside both of you, since both of you make the link.

Is all that still the cloak that she's got there?\n\nGA: That's part of the snake.\n\nSG: Is that still a snake?\n\nGA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers.

Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley's relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\nLB: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

You have to react instantly and it has a lot-- Your  style of how you learn to get by in the world when you were young, it's sometimes  real and applicable when you're older, so it can be a problem. It's also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn't really get rolling until you're older. People  are much more like their moons when you're kids. \n\nYou grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it's much more, you have no power and you're in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger. \n\nGA: I'm much better in crises. \n\nLB: It's a great one for crises. I have a terrible moon for crisis. Well, it  depends. If it's the kind of thing where somebody else is in trouble, I'm great  because it's empathy, but I've been in a situation where people-- I had a guy back  me into the corner and be ready to rape me and I'm sitting there empathizing, it's  like, \"You can be useless.\" If somebody else is in trouble and fine, I'm in trouble. I  would [inaudible 00:38:02] but it's interesting. I always fascinated watching people  who I know really well, and so I've seen them go through like real heavy, \"All right,  now we have to deal with something real fast.\" \n\nIt's like you just see them absolutely clear. You would be real fast right on there.  Your only problem's you might react too fast to things without thinking. There \nwouldn't be any time lag and you wouldn't get thrown. You could like get right into it  and deal with [inaudible 00:38:36]. It's a real different chart [inaudible 00:38:52] \n\nGA: Oh, yes. \n\nLB: Virgo, Scorpio [inaudible 00:38:54] \n\nGA: Woo, heavy.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

We know it's going to happen in the next four years and to try and imagine  how you can prepare for this is overwhelming, but I'm sort of psyched. [laughter] I  think it'll be real interesting. Anyway, that's the generational stuff. The third planet  sun house-- Planet that's connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It's like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It's like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.\n\nGA: Wow. \n\nLB: Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it's  very disorienting, and it's very exciting. It's not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It's much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It's exciting, and  it's sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It's like when you're doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That's Uranus, obviously. \n\nUranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There's a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Pluto","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=863,1025"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus represents change, revolution, independence, and individual power.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs.

What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over.

Then Pisces is the age of the martyrs. We were thinking about all this stuff.\n\nGA: Jesus Christ.\n\nLB: Yes. Taurus astrologically would make sense.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\nLB: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

You have to react instantly and it has a lot-- Your  style of how you learn to get by in the world when you were young, it's sometimes  real and applicable when you're older, so it can be a problem. It's also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn't really get rolling until you're older. People  are much more like their moons when you're kids. \n\nYou grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it's much more, you have no power and you're in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger. \n\nGA: I'm much better in crises. \n\nLB: It's a great one for crises. I have a terrible moon for crisis. Well, it  depends. If it's the kind of thing where somebody else is in trouble, I'm great  because it's empathy, but I've been in a situation where people-- I had a guy back  me into the corner and be ready to rape me and I'm sitting there empathizing, it's  like, \"You can be useless.\" If somebody else is in trouble and fine, I'm in trouble. I  would [inaudible 00:38:02] but it's interesting. I always fascinated watching people  who I know really well, and so I've seen them go through like real heavy, \"All right,  now we have to deal with something real fast.\" \n\nIt's like you just see them absolutely clear. You would be real fast right on there.  Your only problem's you might react too fast to things without thinking. There \nwouldn't be any time lag and you wouldn't get thrown. You could like get right into it  and deal with [inaudible 00:38:36]. It's a real different chart [inaudible 00:38:52] \n\nGA: Oh, yes. \n\nLB: Virgo, Scorpio [inaudible 00:38:54] \n\nGA: Woo, heavy.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

We know it's going to happen in the next four years and to try and imagine  how you can prepare for this is overwhelming, but I'm sort of psyched. [laughter] I  think it'll be real interesting. Anyway, that's the generational stuff. The third planet  sun house-- Planet that's connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It's like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It's like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.\n\nGA: Wow. \n\nLB: Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it's  very disorienting, and it's very exciting. It's not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It's much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It's exciting, and  it's sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It's like when you're doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That's Uranus, obviously. \n\nUranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There's a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Pluto","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=863,1025"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus represents change, revolution, independence, and individual power.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs.

What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over.

Then Pisces is the age of the martyrs. We were thinking about all this stuff.\n\nGA: Jesus Christ.\n\nLB: Yes. Taurus astrologically would make sense.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\nLB: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

You have to react instantly and it has a lot-- Your  style of how you learn to get by in the world when you were young, it's sometimes  real and applicable when you're older, so it can be a problem. It's also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn't really get rolling until you're older. People  are much more like their moons when you're kids. \n\nYou grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it's much more, you have no power and you're in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger. \n\nGA: I'm much better in crises. \n\nLB: It's a great one for crises. I have a terrible moon for crisis. Well, it  depends. If it's the kind of thing where somebody else is in trouble, I'm great  because it's empathy, but I've been in a situation where people-- I had a guy back  me into the corner and be ready to rape me and I'm sitting there empathizing, it's  like, \"You can be useless.\" If somebody else is in trouble and fine, I'm in trouble. I  would [inaudible 00:38:02] but it's interesting. I always fascinated watching people  who I know really well, and so I've seen them go through like real heavy, \"All right,  now we have to deal with something real fast.\" \n\nIt's like you just see them absolutely clear. You would be real fast right on there.  Your only problem's you might react too fast to things without thinking. There \nwouldn't be any time lag and you wouldn't get thrown. You could like get right into it  and deal with [inaudible 00:38:36]. It's a real different chart [inaudible 00:38:52] \n\nGA: Oh, yes. \n\nLB: Virgo, Scorpio [inaudible 00:38:54] \n\nGA: Woo, heavy.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

We know it's going to happen in the next four years and to try and imagine  how you can prepare for this is overwhelming, but I'm sort of psyched. [laughter] I  think it'll be real interesting. Anyway, that's the generational stuff. The third planet  sun house-- Planet that's connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It's like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It's like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.\n\nGA: Wow. \n\nLB: Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it's  very disorienting, and it's very exciting. It's not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It's much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It's exciting, and  it's sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It's like when you're doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That's Uranus, obviously. \n\nUranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There's a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Pluto","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=863,1025"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus represents change, revolution, independence, and individual power.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs.

What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over.

There's a real yearning for that and it doesn't come very easily at all.\n\nI don't know, there's a lot of things. First of all, there's really wanting that and also being afraid of it. Usually, wherever you have Saturn, you can go in one of a couple different directions with it. It's all like, there's a blockage and you can scatter in one of two ways. You can either get into a thing of you're completely obsessed with the relationships or you get into a thing of you're fiercely independent and you don't need a relationship.\n\nGA: I do both. [laughs]\n\nLB: There's a real thing of being incredibly aware of your own need for a relationship and vulnerability and feeling like you're incredibly needy or all this stuff.

There wasn't a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way.

It's like you're Neptune and Virgo is really hovering on Libra, but the sun is very strong in Libra. Actually there's this thing called decans, where they divide the sign up into three pieces, and the first one is the most that sign, in a way. The Libra Libras is the first 10 degrees, and then the second 10 degrees would be the next air sign along, which would be Aquarius. There's an Aquarian tinge to those Libras. Then the third one is the next one along, which is Geminis, Gemini-ish Libras, but you're the Libra Libra.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/natal_chart_for_gea_by_liza_biow_brooklyn_05_june_1983/canvas/5#t=1157,1234"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/natal_chart_for_gea_by_liza_biow_brooklyn_05_june_1983/canvas/5/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: The woman who did the gnostic circle, she does that with the [unintelligible 00:19:08].

It's also because of your Saturn is retrograde, which is different, but it also has to do with not being very well defended against the world, psychically. Especially with sun conjunct Neptune. There really is this thing of a real strong, empathic connection with everything living around you.\n\nGA: Like it hurt me when people were turning off the cigarettes on the grass. The grass is alive.\n\nLB: Right, that kind of stuff. It could be really agonizing on some level to be that in tune with what's going on. This is the problem with people with strong Neptune things is you're so aware of everyone's pain or everyone's whatever that you can't deal with it. It's like having skin of parchment or something. You're feeling everything's pain and everybody's pain and everybody's whatever. Even good stuff can be completely overwhelming because you've got everybody's.\n\nGA: Then I tend to go the opposite way, to become callous, just in self-protection.

There's also, one of the things that people with that kind of stuff tend to do is withdraw into a real fantasy world. I have a moon in Pisces, a really strong moon in Pisces, which is similar stuff.

There wasn't a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way.

Aquarians are like this in general because they're ruled by that planet, but Aquarians always have this thing, they love to say things that are going to make everybody's jaw drop.

There wasn't a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way.

That's what I wanted to tell you because I didn't  want to just leave you in mid-word and say, \"Oh, I got to go now.\"  \n\nCM: Okay.  \n\nAmy: What I do want to do-- You've had your charts done before haven't you?  \n\nCM: Yes, not very formally. I worked at a place where everybody--  \n\nAmy: Had their chart done.  \n\nCM: Yes. Where a person who was-- I worked in this house food place and then  a woman who did a lot of astrology had done my chart but between breaks she  would show me it.  \n\nAmy: Oh, I see.  \n\nCM: It wasn't like we had a real formal thing.  \n\nAmy: I get you. All right, well, but you're familiar with how a chart is set up, aren't  you?  \n\nCM: Yes.  \n\nAmy: The fact that there are planets, and signs, and houses and that kind of stuff.  \n\nCM: Yes.  \n\nAmy: Well, what I'll do then is first of all I'm just going to talk about your chart as a  whole and give you an overview. The second thing I'll do is talk about your sun sign,  your rising sign, and your moon sign, and how they fit together, and how they work.  The third thing I'll do if we have time is to go through each house individually and talk  about what's in each house until I get around to the whole again. Okay?  \n\nCM: Okay.  \n\nAmy: For sure if you have any questions or comments or anything to just go right  ahead. \n\nCM: Okay.

What that means is that when you  were born Cherrié, at the moment of your birth there happened to have been the  planet situated themselves in such a way that they actually formed these big shapes  in the middle of the sky. To have one is not super unusual but it's not that common  either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they're very important  because they tend to color everything else in the chart. \nYou have both a T-square and a Yod, and the T-square is caused because you have  two planets that were 180 degrees away from each other, so they formed this  straight line, the red line. Then you had another planet that was 90 degrees from the  other two, so it forms two right angles or a T shape in the middle of the sky. The T square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit  together. However, X can be anything, Cherrié. That X could be a relationship, it  could be money, it could be material object, it could be work, it could be the perfect  body. \n\nIt could be the perfect mind, it could be anything and X can change. You can decide  oh, oh, this is really X on Tuesday and then maybe by Thursday, you can say well I  thought about it again and I realized that's not really X, this is X instead. If you do  decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it,  for a while it really does make you feel complete. After a while it really gives you the  feeling of just like gee, this isn't quite right, it isn't quite working. You really feel oh I  have to go off and I have to find something else to fulfill me. \n\nIt's really analogous to going around and looking for wall outlets. You find an outlet,  and you plug your plug into it and the energy starts flowing through and you feel  really great and then all of a sudden you short out. Of course, the most normal thing  to do in that point is to pull your plug out of the outlet and to say, \"Oh what a stupid  outlet, it isn't working, I got to go find another outlet.\" What the T-square is saying is  that you do have the short circuit inside of you. Now the short circuit is caused  because you have an imbalance of energy. \n\nNow you're not doomed to the short circuit. It's not saying to you, \"Oh, well, tough  luck, Cherrié, for the rest of your life you're going to be like this.\" It's saying no, okay  there is an imbalance and you can write the imbalance. Now what the imbalance is  depends upon the particular planets in the T-square. Now in your case, you have a  special kind of T-square, because it doesn't just involve planets. It also involves  these two points which are called the nodes. Now the nodes, are not really planets at  all. \n\nIf you take the orbit of the earth around the sun, and then you take the orbit of the  earth's moon around the earth, those orbits cross in two places. The intersection that  faces north is the north node, and it points up, and it represents breaking away from  past life karma. The intersection that faces down is the self node, and it represents  getting sucked into past life karma. \n\nCM: Great.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=137,352"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: To have a T-square with the nodes first of all Cherrié it's telling you that this is  an old energy. That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, \"Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.\" What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it's just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.  \n\nWhat this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn't just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It's saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, \"Yes, this is who I am. I'm the power and what I want is right for everybody.\"  \n\nNow where's Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it's in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.  \n\nHaving Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that's the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn't start off  saying, \"Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I'm just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.\" It's saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.  \n\nAll right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you're breaking away is by seeing the truth that you're breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it's all illusions.  \n\nIt's not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It's telling you that you've been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It's not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You've already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don't have to see, \"Oh gee, what is power? I can't use it blah blah blah.\"  \n\nIn fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it's saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it's like, \"Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I'm  not here.\" Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, \"Who me, Cherrié? Oh no, not me. I don't know what you're talking  about. What power? I got no power.\"  \n\nYet at the same time, the people are there saying, \"Oh, Cherrié she doesn't have any  power.?\" It's like, \"What do you mean I don't any? Hey, listen, I have all this power  and I got to use this power. Here I am.\" Then it's like, \"Oh my God, what did I do?\"  \"Oh, no. No, I was just kidding. Just kidding, folks. No, I don't have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.\" It goes back and forth. There are some days in  which you're right up there, you're right there looking straight into your destiny and  saying, \"Yes, this is who I am, and this is who I have to be.\" Other days you're just  looking at that and saying, \"Oh my God, I can't possibly accept this power. This is  just much too scary. It's much too much. No, I can't deal with it.\"  \n\nIt is this duality of saying, \"Yes, I want it. No, I don't. Yes, I've got to have it. No, I  can't.\" What you're trying to do is to find the perfect balance, is to be able to be a  channel of that power, accept your power, but not feel that you have to take on too  much of the power and not feel that you can't accept yourself as you truly are. It's a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it's saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it. That's a really  important energy with the T.

First of all, it's the illusion that  you can use power any old way you want. Every time you get a little bit too egoistic  or too cocky with that power, you do get smashed. Every time you say, \"Oh, right.  Hey, I want this.\" You talk yourself into thinking, \"Oh, this is for everyone else, and  it's really for Cherrié and it's long, and it's like the neon signs go off and the sirens,  and it's like, \"Don, don, don, wonk.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"Whoops, okay, I'm not going to do it this time.\" The second side though, is  the more insidious side, because that part of the illusion is the illusion that your  negativity does to say to you, \"Oh, well, you can't have power. You're just too  messed up. You'll really misuse it. You can't touch it.\" The reason why it does that is  from your dark side's point of view, you're in this really terrible position because first  of all, it had power.  \n\nIt really had it, and you used it, and your dark side loved it because it had all this  incredible energy. It was like, \"Hey, I get to do whatever I want.\" Then you got  smashed. You really did get smashed. You went through a number of very painful  lifetimes, and your dark side lost its power. Now, here you are in this situation where  there's this power hanging right in front of you, and it's saying to you, \"Cherrié, use it.\"  You're there going, \"All right. I have to use it.\"  \n\nNow, your dark side is fit to be tied because it looks at this and it says, \"What do you  mean she can use it? This is mine.\" It's being taught, \"Uh-uh. You don't touch it. You  don't get near it. You can't even breathe on it.\" Your dark side's freaking out saying,  \"Well, if I can't have it, she can't either.\" It's energy, instead of trying to co-opt the  power, it knows enough now that it can't possibly co-opt the power. \n\nYou are in no way an evil person, and you're not going to be an evil person. It knows  it can't do that. What it figures it can do is to just keep you away from it. Because it  says, \"Hey, I don't want to get burnt. I don't want to get transformed. If I keep her  from being transformed, I'm going to not be transformed either.\" It's always in there  creating all these illusions about the power, saying to you, \"Don't touch it. Don't touch  it. It'll hurt you. It's bad. You can't handle it. You're not ready.\"  \n\nAll these things so that you'll step back and say, \"Oh, Gee, oh, I'm not ready.  Someday when I'm ready, I'll touch it,\" or, \"Oh Gee, oh God, this is so much and I  can't handle this.\" Or, \"Oh wow, what if I blow it? Everybody looks at me and says,  gee, Cherrié, we were really depending on you, and you really blew it. Oh God, you  really let us down.\" It's got all these really insidious ways to get to you that are so  subtle that they're not out front. You can say, \"Well, gee, I must be doing this from  the right thing. I just want to be ready. I'm doing this with a really good conscience.  It's not like I'm trying to mess things up.\"  \n\nIt also can get you through other people. It can say, \"Oh, Cherrié, you can't think  about yourself right now. You have to think about this other person or these other  people.\" Because then you can say, \"Oh, yes. Right. Well, see, I'm not being selfish.  I'm not being messed up. I have to go deal with this person, or this situation, or this  community, or whatever it is.\" It's telling you that you have to be really careful about  the illusions that your negative energy creates under the guise of positive energy.  The way you can tell is how it feels, because no matter what it sounds intellectually,  no matter how much you say to yourself, \"Oh Gee, really, it's got to be like this. It's  really got to be this way. It sounds really good in my mind. It's really creating it.\" If it  in your heart, you just don't feel good about it, you're just saying, \"I've got do this. I've  got to.\" Then you know, you've got to go with what your heart says.  \n\nWhat your negative energy does is it creates all this mental veneer, it keeps pulling  things up in your mind and saying, \"Cherrié, what about this? Oh, and how can you  think you're ready? Isn't that ego?\" Then you think, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:15:44], it  must be ego. I can't think I'm ready, so I'm not ready.\" Whereas it's all that energy  saying, pull her back. Pull her back. Don't let her go. Don't let her go.\" That's why  really accepting your destiny is really confronting that intellectualization of that power  as well. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=687,961"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now every T-square has a point where it needs to balance because it is a T. There is  no planet on the chart because if there was a planet, then you wouldn't have a T at  all, you'd have a cross, which is a completely different energy. That missing planet is  called the void. It is directly opposite the stem. Your stem is in Taurus. Your void  then would be in Scorpio in the first house.  \n\nNow, the first house is the house of self-identity, and Scorpio is power. What this  says is that the thing that you really need to do is to identify with the truth of your  power. The truth that you are a divine warrior in this lifetime. I mean, you really have  to be. There's lots of things that you have to get out there and confront that Cherrie  and her Libra essence would rather not deal with it all.  \n\nYour Libras, there're going, \"What? Me? Oh no, not me. I'm just sitting here spacing  out.\" Whereas that Scorpio energy is right in there. It's going, \"You are a divine  warrior. You got to get out there. You have to clothe yourself in the truth. You have to hold the sword of truth and you have to communicate it. You have to be it.\" There's a  lot of parts of you that are in there saying, \"No, I don't want to look at this destiny  because it hurts. Besides it's scary. Can't I just stay here and live in a little house on  the ocean and not look at anything.\"  \n\nYou're being told, \"Uh-uh, Uh-uh, you got to get out there and confront.\" That's the  thing that's really scary, is that sense of, \"Oh, I've really got to get out there and  confront. I've really got to get out there and deal with the energy.\" The other side of it  is it says that you've got to really use that power that for many lifetimes you've been  sitting on it and really saying, \"I'm not ready, I'm not ready. I can't use it. I'll just blow  it again. I'll blow it again.\" This lifetime, you're right there. It's like your divine energy  has come right down to you and it's saying to you, \"Okay, Cherrie, this is the time.  This is it. You really have to use the energy. You cannot possibly ignore this.\"  \n\nYou're finding yourself having to really deal with that energy, having to accept it in  spite of yourself. Now, the fact that the Scorpio is in the void does not mean that you  don't connect to Scorpios. As a matter of fact, what it says is that at times Scorpios  can be incredible catalysts to your life. Because it's almost like their energy,  especially if their sun or any planet that they have fits into the void. It's saying that  then that energy really helps you to realize the T-square energy. Of course, Barbara  is a Scorpio. I don't know if her son, I can't remember what the degree of her son is,  so I don't know if it fits into this or not. Do you know what day she was born on-- November?  \n\nCM: I'm just forgetting. Oh, no. 17th.  \n\nAmy: 17th. There is a real good chance that her Sun would fit into this void. That  would just be an interesting thing because it would say that in her very essence  would help you to work out this T-square energy.

Now you also have a Yod. Now a Yod is a partially  resolved T-Square. It's as if you've gotten a T-square and almost worked it out to  completion, but just didn't quite manage to get it totally synthesized, like in another  life. A Yod is called a Yod because actually Yod is the Hebrew letter for Y, and it is a  Y shape. You've got two sets of planets that are 60 degrees away from each other.  They form a 60-degree angle, then both of them are 150 degrees away from the  stem point.  \n\nIt's interesting that the stem point here is also Jupiter. Jupiter is the stem for both the  T Square and the Yod. What this says is that you have to be really careful at pushing  yourself too hard. It's like you've wanted to get through this karma so badly that  you've almost decided in past lives that you were just going to burn straight through  it. You had at least in one lifetime, I know of at least one in which you were just, ugh. You just decided, lay it on me Lord. It was just like, \"Okay, I am just going to totally  burn through this. I am not going to get stuck in this again.\" You did have, I don't  know if it was your last lifetime or the lifetime for it but it was incredibly painful. It was  very much involved in this intense victimization experience. Your death was a particularly incredibly horrible death where you died. You were raped and murdered  in your death and it was just this incredible thing [crosstalk] to sustain. Pardon?  \n\nCM: I was saying, why does it feel so recent? \n\nAmy: Recent? [inaudible 00:21:16] I'm with you. \n\nCM: When you said that, it felt so recent. \n\nAmy: Oh, yes. It was so traumatic for your soul. Yet, see, the thing that was so  intense about it is that in this really weird way, you engineered it because it was  almost like you said, \"Okay, that's it. Okay, maybe I victimized some people. Well,  I'm just going to burn right through it. I'm just going to rip it off my soul because I'm  not going to deal with this anymore.\" See, I feel like your misuse of power was  probably a number of lifetimes ago and you started off dealing with it more  intellectually, and you got very frustrated where you felt like, I have to get back to  using this power. I can't stand being impotent and not being able to use the power. \n\nWhat you decided to do was to just sear it right off of you and you had this life. It was  weird because it's almost like you didn't have to go through it. It's like you just got  this thing in your head that you had to release the energy and it's like you couldn't  realize that the way you had to release it was to forgive yourself. It was you couldn't  forgive yourself. You were so tied into this idea that somehow you were really evil,  that you couldn't just say, \"Hey, look, just forgive yourself. Let it go.\" \n\nIt was almost like in that lifetime, things just kept happening to you that were  incredible. It was almost like one of those catastrophic lifetimes where you just could  think, what next? How could something else happen to this woman? Yet you would  just keep walking right into it. It was like, this isn't hard enough. This isn't heavy  enough. I'm not going to be convinced that I'm released until I hit something really  heavy. \n\nFinally, when you went into that death, it was about the heaviest thing that could  possibly happen to you. It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing? You don't have to go through this.  Are you crazy? What it set up there Cherrie, is this real, almost like this intense self hatred because you felt like, \"I can't believe I did this. Talk about stupid.\" Then in this  lifetime, you have to forgive yourself doubly because not only do you have to forgive  yourself for the misuse of power but you have to forgive yourself for your ultimate  victimization.

That's a good thing because you know it's like, \"I'm not going to take this  again and I'm not going to let other women take it which is a really good energy.\"  What happens is you take it really personally then and you say, \"Well, sure you are  really messed up.\" If you ever get taken advantage of, it's like reliving the rape and  the murder. It's like reliving that energy. Sometimes you're really confused at why  you take hurt so hard. Even if someone is just minimally hurtful to you, maybe they  don't even mean it. There's a part of you that just takes it so into your heart and it's  so overwhelming to you, and you get really angry with yourself.  \n\nYou feel like, \"Will you just stop it? You are not going to be like this now. Just be  strong. Be together. Why are you feeling like this? That person can't hurt you. Don't  let them hurt you.\" Yet, at the same time, there's this incredible pain that just washes  over you and this incredible feeling of hopelessness and of destitution and feeling  really alone and there is no way that anyone can help you or love you. It's almost like  just feeling that you're falling into this incredibly deep, dark pit. What that is, is that's  that woman in you that went through that, that still is experiencing it. It's like every  time anyone hurts you, she relives it. It's like all she wants to do is die. She really  wants to die. She just wants to let go.  \n\nShe doesn't want to have to be stuck there being tortured anymore. The thing that  you have to do is you have to release her because you don't need her anger  anymore. You needed her anger when you were a little girl because you needed it so  that you wouldn't buy into it and so that you wouldn't get caught up in the bullshit.  You needed it so that you wouldn't get stuck in all that Libra openness to other  people. She kept you. Every time you started losing it and started being too open to  other people or losing your integrity or losing your ideal, she was right there being  angry, saying, \"How can you do that? How can you let me down? They hurt you.  Don't let them hurt you again.\" She was really necessary but at this point, Cherrie,  you don't need her anger.  \n\nIf you buy into it, if you let her continue to make you feel the hurt and to make you  feel the torture, you're keeping yourself from being the power that you have to be  because not only does she have anger, she has fear. She's the part of you. It's  almost like she's this little personality inside of you and she's the part of you that  every time you start feeling really powerful shuts down because what happens is she  gets scared. It's that thing of, \"Oh my God, they're going to do it to you again.\" She  just shuts down. She makes you feel this incredible panic, this incredible fear. She  can't keep you from doing your destiny but she can make it a lot harder.

I also know that  you're tired, that you can't continue like this and you need to let go.\" It's like you've  got to let her stop hurting because she hurts all the time. She's that part of you that  sometimes when you're alone or sometimes when things are the best when you're  really feeling good, you feel a lot of love, you feel a lot of respect, you feel a lot of satisfaction. She's that part of you that can't let go, that just can't accept it. It's like  she wants to accept it so badly. It's like she's right.  \n\nThere's the river and she really wants to step over it and she's in there going, \"I can't  Cherrie, I'm too afraid. I'm too afraid that if I accept it, if I feel the love, if I feel the  positive energy, then it's just going to destroy me. Then they'll get me.\" Then they'll  say, \"Ah, we got you. We knew it. We knew that if you just relaxed and you felt good,  then we could really make you hurt.\"  \n\nShe just can't. That's why you think sometimes you're so crazy because sometimes  when things are the best, you feel the most panic-stricken because she's in there  saying, \"Oh God, I can't deal. It hurts too much.\" It's like if you've ever been out in  the real, real, real cold and it's so cold and you come inside, and you've just gotten  numb, and then you start feeling things. It just trickles and hurts and you get the pins  and needles. It's that energy where she's just gotten so numb that when she starts to  feel love, she freaks out. She just freaks out because it just hurts so much.  \n\nIt's the same thing with sexuality. It's like sometimes when you feel the most  openness in sexuality, you feel the most desire to shut down because it's the same  thing because in her head, you know, sexuality is bad. It's what got her in trouble. It  says, \"All right, you feel good about this. Well, listen, sweetheart, I'm going to make  you shut down.\" Sometimes after the most wonderful sexual experience, instead of  feeling good, you just feel awful because it's like opening up to that energy.  \n\nIt's really realizing that it is okay and you can forgive yourself and you can accept  yourself and things are going to be all right in this lifetime. That's like a really really  scary energy. It just feels so scary to you that you just feel like, \"Oh, how can I  accept this? I can't accept this. If I accept this, then what kinds of other things are  going to happen?\" That's why it is just so important for you to be able to let her go  and to be able to say to her, \"Okay, you don't have to guard me anymore. You don't  have to make me accept you anymore. You don't have to make it happen because I  know what I have to do and I'll protect you.\"","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Sexuality","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Relationships","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=1687,1884"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: The other thing you have to realize is, because your moon is trying your Pluto, you  have a really really strong guardian angel, and your guardian angel is right there to  protect you, to make sure that it's okay, to make sure that it's all right for you to  accept your energy, to make sure that it's okay for you to be who you really are. It's  saying that it's going to protect you, not just physically, but psychically as well. It's  really, really important for you to accept that psychic energy, and it's really important  for you to really trust that energy inside of yourself and know that you do not have to  take on the pain and you do not have to take on the negativity. \n\nThe key, as I'm going back to my original thing, is the Jupiter, because what that  Jupiter is saying is that in this lifetime, you just have to be very careful not to push  too hard. When you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, you have got to pull  back. There's a difference between just sort of normal fear and being overwhelmed.  The fear is just like, okay, you're afraid, but you still feel the energy. You still feel like  I've got the energy, I've got the strength, I've got the power, I've just got to go with it.  There's a difference between that and that panicky, overwhelming feeling of just like,  \"Oh, my God, I'm just exhausted, I'm drained. I don't have any energy. I cannot do  this.\" \n\nIt's really really important for you to know that you have to let go of this energy. It's  really important for you to know that you do not have to pick up on it, that you do  have to release yourself and feel the release because it's just a really important  energy for you, it's something you need to experience deep inside of yourself. Okay,  now, the other way that the Yod works is, okay, so then you split and you've got  these two battery of planets. First of all, you've got the moon conjunct to Mars. Now,  the moon is the intuitive, subconscious part of yourself and Mars is action energy. It's  motivation. Now, this says Cherrie, that you get guided intensely intuitively all the  time.

It's saying that you  really have to pay attention to this guidance. Now, the problem is that the guidance  comes intuitively and that it's really, really easy for you to block that intuition. It's  really, really easy for you to not connect to that truth inside of yourself at times,  because your sun is conjunct to your mercury, which means that Mercury's mental  energy sun is being-ness. You just accept your mind energy. Your mind really comes  in there and it really says, \"What are you talking about, Cherrie? What's this? What  do you mean, what are you talking about? How can you believe this?\" It's saying that  you pick up on energy all the time.  \n\nI walk into this room and you've never seen me before, and sure, your mind's going  to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's Amy, and she looks like this, and she does this  and blah, and blah,\" but your intuition is going to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's  Amy. Well, she's this, she's that. She said something.\" Nine out of ten times, you're  absolutely right with your intuition. The problem is that your mind comes in and it  says to you, \"What the hell are you talking about, Cherrie? You don't even know this  person. How do you know that this is going on?\" Especially because you don't just  do it about people, you do it about rooms and dogs and cats and books and  situations.  \n\nYou could walk into a room and maybe it's a beautiful room and there's all kinds of  nice people there. You say, \"There's a lot of tension here.\" Maybe someone with you  is saying \"Cherrie are you crazy? Are you out of your mind, everything's fine. What's  wrong with know?\" And maybe say, your mind goes, oh, yes. Boy, are you stupid?  [inaudible 00:35:39]. Then, you know, maybe three weeks later when a friend  comes to you and says, \"Well, Cherrie, you remember we went to that party and there  was this stuff. I didn't realize it, but there was all this stuff going on between so and  so and so and so. They just had this big fight, and they're not living together  anymore, and blah and blah.\"  \n\nYou're saying to yourself, \"That was the tension that I felt.\" Now, the problem is that  your mind has absolutely no conscience. That lots of times what happens is it says  to you, \"Oh, you're full of shit? What's wrong with you? You can't trust such and  such.\" Then when weeks later, you find out that such and such is true, your mind has  no qualms about coming back and saying to you, \"Cherrie, you knew that that was  true. Why didn't you do something about it? Oh, boy, you're stupid. I can't believe it.\"  It's the kind of thing where, see, your mind will switch sides. It doesn't care. It just  wants to be right.  \n\nThat's why it's really important for you to give enough credence to your own intuition  because you get guided so much. I cannot stress how much you are guided. You get such strong guidance energy, and yet at the same time, it's really easy for you to  negate that guidance. Lots of times it's like running around the rose bush. You go  around and around and around, and finally, you're so exhausted, you just give up,  and you just give into the intuition. Then you realize that you just should have given  into it a long time ago. You say, \"Oh, wow, this was right. What's wrong with me?  This was absolutely right. Why wasn't I trusting this energy?\"  \n\nIt is just really really important for you to make sure that you do trust this energy, and  you do know that it is absolutely right for you, and you do know that this is the right  energy, and you can give yourself a lot of support for what you're actually feeling and  realizing that that's exactly right for you. It's exactly what you've got to be feeling at  this time. The other thing that goes along with that is just the realization that you  really need to follow your hunches. You just get hunches about everything, and  they're really gut-level. Lots of times you don't follow them because you are scared,  because you think, who am I to have these kinds of hunches? Obviously, they can't  be true. They're not true.  \n\nThen in reality, you wish that you had followed them. Now, the moon energy is the  intuitive energy. It's also one of the female energies because it's the real mother  nurturance. It's like the goddess energy, and Mars Is the so-called male energy.  Because your moon is conjunct to Mars, it's saying that you really have to synthesize  your male energy inside of yourself. Because what happened after you went through  that rape and murder, I mean, obviously you just [unintelligible 00:38:31] to your  male energy. You just said, \"All right, that's it. I don't connect to it.\" The problem is,  that it's your male energy that holds your power.  \n\nYou've been trying to get it into your female energy, but your male energy isn't about  to let it go, not now, anyway. What you need to do is you need to synthesize your  male energy into your female energy. As long as you hate your male energy, you're  not going to be able to serve your power. It's really really important for you to accept  that male energy into yourself. Now, you don't have to term it male energy. It's just  the so-called male energy. It's just that power. It's that aggression, it's that ability to  really focus, to really deal outside of yourself. You have identified it as your male  energy in past lives. As far as you're concerned, you still identify it as your male  energy.  \n\nThat it's really important for you to really bring that back into yourself and get it to  really hook up with your female energy and get it to really hook up as a positive  energy. As long as you see that power as negative, as long as you see that power as  an ability to hurt, you're not going to be able to be 100% effective. It's really  important for you to draw it back into yourself and to really tie it up to your goddess  energy and really accept it in the depths of your soul.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mercury","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=2032,2397"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now, the other side of the Yod is that you've got Saturn, Neptune, and Venus all  conjunct, which means that they were so close together in the sky, they just lined up  together around the sun.

You have what's known as a  soulmate or a karmic mate. This is a person that you have been involved with in past  lives in many different ways. You may have been her lover, you may have been even  enemies, or parent and child, or teacher and student, or siblings, or colleagues, or all  kinds of things, and in this lifetime, you come together with the potential to be one  with each other on all levels, mentally, physically, psychically, sexually, emotionally,  spiritually, every single level you can think of, you have the ability to be one with this  person.  \n\nHowever, there is no way to tell if someone is your soulmate by what sign she is, by  what the person looks like, by what they do, by when you meet this person. There is  no way to tell by any external means. The only way to tell when a person is your  soulmate is by the fulfillment of different indications. There are also ways to tell  because this relationship is not a lot of things. It is definitely not in any way, shape,  or form an abusive relationship. It cannot possibly be an abusive relationship. It is  also not in any way, shape, or form a relationship that does not allow you to be your  true self. This person has got to totally support you in your true destiny, just as you  must support her in her true destiny.  \n\nNow one of the indications is the fact that you find you cannot separate from this  person, literally, physically. No matter how much you try to be apart, there is some  greater force than yourself bringing you together so that you find that you can meet  this person and maybe at first you don't feel a big thing. Maybe you meet this person  at a party or a bar or a conference or a meeting or something like that and you might  feel like, \"Oh.\" Somehow you're going to keep connecting to this person. It's like,  \"Look, Cherie, this is the person. This is it,\" which is why you can never meet the  person and then do nothing and then someday wake up when you're 85 and in the middle of the night and say  \n\nCM: She is the one. [crosstalk]-  \n\nAmy: -\"Oh my God, it was that birth and then I blew it.\" It's not like that. You get  chance after chance after chance, which is why even if you're together and you feel  like, \"Oh, fuck, I don't want to deal with this.\" Forget it. You find that you've got to be  there. You've got to work it out together. The second qualification is the fact that you are willing to put more into this relationship than any other relationship you have ever  experienced. This relationship forces you to go beyond your own ego and your own  sense of self and it's mutual. You are both working out this relationship energy, so  it's not like you can't do it. It's like you are forced to deal with it. You are forced to do it. You find that in spite of yourself, your head might be going, \"No way, Cherie, why  should you work it out? Forget it. You are not going to work it out,\" and your heart is  saying, \"You get in there and you work it out. You are not about to not work it out.\"  You find that you cannot help but work out the relationship. You find that you cannot  help but deal with this relationship in a complete way.  \n\nCM: It's terrifying. [laughs]  \n\nAmy: I know it is.  \n\nCM: Just saying.  \n\nAmy: It is. The third qualification is the fact that the relationship itself follows a  certain pattern. First, there'll be a plateau and everything will be very nice and very  easy and very lovely. Little by little, it builds up to some kind of crisis point. Now it  might be your crisis, it might be the other person's crisis, it might be internal, it might  be external, but it's some kind of crisis point. You find that the more you're able to  work out the crisis point, the more able you are to love each other, to be together, to  experience oneness with each other. Then it goes to another plateau until it builds up  to another crisis point. The amount of time between the crisis points depends upon  the couple.  \n\nFor some couples, it's every two minutes, and for other couples, it's every five years.  It just depends on what it is that you're working out. The fourth qualification is the fact  that you find it's really difficult to explain why you love this person. You can't explain  it. It goes beyond explanation. Cause you feel like, \"I love her because she's so-- No, that's  not it. It must be because she's-- No, that's not it. I think it's because of-- No, that's  not it.\" You find that you just cannot possibly explain it. It's just, it's so deep. It feels  so intense inside of yourself. You cannot explain it in any way, shape, or form. It's a  really deep energy. All you can do is really trust that energy and know that this is  exactly the right energy for you.

What you do after that its up to you. It doesn't say, \"Oh, and you'll live happily ever  after.\" You still have to work out the relationship. Obviously, for you, it's a very  intense energy because you do have a real struggle opening up your heart.  Obviously, this person is definitely going to open up your heart, and she is not going  to allow you to close down. The other thing is that it's really forcing you to let go of  pain around relationship. It's forcing you to work out sexuality, and it's forcing you to  open up to the truth inside of yourself. It's forcing you to say, \"Yes, this is who I really  have to be. I can not be anybody else.\"  \n\nNow the other thing it says is that with the Saturn conjuncture Neptune that in this  lifetime, you really have to use your healing energy in your work. Of course, you can  only do that when you experience love in your heart, and that you really have to experience a deep openness and a deep energy inside of yourself, and that you just  have to know that this is the truth, that you have really got to experience the truth  inside of yourself. You've really got to experience the knowledge that you are a  healer in this lifetime and that you're really meant to use the love that you're feeling  from other people to learn to love yourself, to learn to forgive yourself.  \n\nThe key here is self-forgiveness, it is self-acceptance, and it's the knowledge that all  you can do is really, really be open to this truth. All you can do is really, really be  open to what you know is true inside of yourself. Now Saturn, Neptune, and Venus  are sextile the moon and Mars. This is interesting because then Venus is sextile the  Mars, which is the union of the so-called male-female energy. It does say that when  they work together, you feel a real sense of completeness and openness inside of  yourself.  \n\nThen these are both in conjunct to Jupiter, which says that at times you feel a real  duality between that really active part of you, the real so-called male aggressive,  active, powerful part of you, and then the real victimization part of you so that what  you're trying to do is to switch energy. You're trying to get the male energy part of  you to experience nurturing, to experience love, to experience hope, to experience  transformation. You're trying to get the female part of you to stop being the victim  because that female part of you still really identifies with the victim. You need to get  her to feel strong, to feel strength to power, aggression, all the things that you want  to feel. You're switching the energy.  \n\nThat's what the Yod is talking about is the real switch of energy will allow you to  release yourself from that duality because it says at times, you really experience that  duality, and it is very confusing to you. Here you are, one day, you can be so strong  and so aggressive and totally like, \"No, I do not experience this pain inside of  myself.\" Then the next day, you can just totally fold in on yourself and experience  real victimization.  \n\nIt's very confusing to you because you feel like, \"What is going on?\" Of course, then  too, you're giving real mixed messages to people. Both I'm invincible, I am strong,  and I'm the complete victim. Then you're feeling like, \"What the hell? What kind of  credibility do I have that I'm expressing both of these energies?\" Yet they're both  there because they're both a part of you. What you're trying to do is to give power to  the victim and give compassion and love to the assertive part of you so that both of  them experience a synthesis and a connection inside of yourself, and that's a really  strong work that you're experiencing at this time.

It's very painful. [crosstalk]  \n\nAmy: I know it's painful.  \n\nCM: -but it's wonderful to have it said back to me. \n\nAmy: It's almost like you have to release the pain. It's painful because it's like  opening up a wound to the air, and yet it's the only way you're going to heal it. That's  the other thing I wanted to say. See because you feel such a need to be powerful,  you feel a lot of shame about the victim, and that's the thing that's really maybe the  most detrimental because you can't see yourself in shame. She herself felt an  incredible amount of shame. It's just that myth. It's that thing of, well, if a woman gets  raped, and if a woman gets heard, it's because she asked for it.  \n\nCM: It's also very Catholic and very Mexican, both of which I am. All the stuff that  you're saying, for me, it's just is so cultural too. Women are thought of particularly  around sexuality, so it's just like the clicks are phenomenon.  \n\nAmy: It's the kind of thing where you felt, so there's that real deep, deep, deep little  well of shame in there that when you start feeling like, \"Hey, I am a really strong  woman. I'm an incredible person. I am a divine warrior.\" That little voice goes, \"Oh  yes. Well, I'll tell you another thing. You are a real complete, total fucked up person.  You were victimized to prove it. On top of it sweetheart, it's going to happen again.\"  \nIt's that thing too. \"Don't let anybody get too close,\" because that goes right into the  lover thing. Here, if there's a person who really loves you and a woman who really  wants to give to you and really wants to totally accept you, then that voice comes up  and says, \"Oh yes, she's going to accept your shame, too.\" It's that feeling of like, \"I  can't let her in. I can't let her close because if she sees she'll be repulsed.\" She'll just  look at you and go, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:53:39]. How can I love that?\" There's that  hedge. It's that little wall you put around yourself and say, \"Oh no, oh no.\" It feels  very virtuous because it feels like, \"Well, I'm doing it for your own good.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"I know I'm a shamed woman, so I can't let you share my shame.\" Yet it's so  bullshit. As you said, it's so cultural. It's what we women have been experiencing for  centuries. eons. Also coming from where you've come from with the Catholicism and with the Mexican culture and then putting it on top of all the karma, it's right there,  and yet what this is saying is that you've just got to break through it. It's really  important for you to realize that you cannot feel ashamed of yourself. See, what  happens is then it gets twisted, and you start feeling ashamed of the power. \n\nInstead of feeling like, \"How can I be ashamed of being a victim? Hey, this is  something I bought into, and I'm not going to buy into it anymore.\" Then what  happens is that voice says, \"Oh, and you should be ashamed of the fact that you're  powerful too. What about all the women who aren't powerful?\" How dare you? How  dare you rub their faces in it? Then you feel like, \"Oh God. Nothing really that terrible  and horrible and disgusting has happened to me and I somehow escaped in this  lifetime.\" Well, it should happen to me, so I should feel ashamed that it hasn't  happened to me as fully as it could.\"  \n\nIt's really getting you both coming and going. That's why it's so important for you to  really release the shame and really allow yourself to feel good about the fact that you  are protected, that you are meant to be a warrior, that you are meant to experience  that power, and that you do not have to be victimized ever again in this lifetime. You  will not be victimized ever again if you choose not to be. That's a really important  karmic lesson for you.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Sexuality","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3083,3346"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Okay. The reason why this is coming up so strongly now is that you are starting about a six-year cycle. That is a very important cycle for you. It's like you started it  actually years ago. You started it about four years ago. You started this very important Saturn experience, and then you had a respite. You had a rest for about a  year, and now you're starting it again.  \n\nFirst Saturn in the sky as you know is continually moving. You happen to have all  this stuff back to back. As you can see, you have so many planets right here. Now  what happened is that you have Saturn, it passed over your 10th house. The 10th  house is the house of work, and Saturn rules work.  \n\nWhen Saturn passes through the 10th house, it says then that you really are  experiencing a real need to deal with your work energy. That was happening, I think  it was around '78. Let me just check. It started at 11 degrees of Leo. You started  experiencing it starting in September of '76, actually. You started experiencing it. It  continued until September of '79. That was over a three-year period. Then you had a  little bit of a respite. Then starting last September, so September of 1980, you  started experiencing it again very intensely, and you will continue experiencing it for  quite a while.  \n\nCM: Now, is that specifically around work again, or this is something [crosstalk]?  \n\nAmy: No, now it's something else. Okay? Now what you're experiencing is a number  of things because first of all, you have your sun in Libra. You also have Saturn in  Libra, and you have your ascendant in Libra. I know you have your ascendant in  Scorpio, excuse me, but your 12th house is ruled by Libra. Whenever Saturn passes  over the sun or Saturn or the 12th house, it creates a very deep experience. Now  your sun is in the same sign as your Saturn and your Saturn is in your 12th house.  It's like having three different cycles all back to back, all affecting you all at the same  time. That's a very intense energy for you. [crosstalk]  \n\nCM: It started in September?  \n\nAmy: It started in September. Now what it does is it affects you on all these different  level. First of all, it affects you with your sun. What it says is that you are then having  to confront all of your own limitations at this time, and you really have to deal with all  the limitations that you create inside of yourself. Also, you're in your Saturn return, and the Saturn cycle affects you in a lot of different ways.  \n\nFirst of all, one of the ways it affects you is that it really forces you to really let go of your childhood and to accept your adult energy so that all of a sudden, you, Cherrie,  are learning to be an adult in a total way. Now what that means is that you're  empowering yourself. You're really accepting your power and your identity on a  whole new level, on a level that you have never experienced before. It's saying then that you really need to deal with a lot of different issues with your Saturn cycle.  \n\nThe first issue is the issue of letting go of your childhood, which means that all of a  sudden, all these things that you have really associated with your childhood. All the  things that you haven't felt ready to deal with, you really have to deal with now. It's really connecting and confronting that energy. Really being able to look at it, really  being able to say, \"Yes, this is something that I really have to deal with. This is  something that I really have to connect to. This is something that I really have to  confront inside of myself.\" Now the second thing that's going on with this is the  realization that you also then have to deal with your work.  \n\nOne of the ways that we decide whether a person is an adult or not is by their work,  which is why obviously for so long women were never considered adults. [chuckles]  You are really looking at your work now and deciding what you're going to do with it. You've got three choices. Either what work you've been doing so far isn't your true  work, and now that you're in your Saturn cycle, you have to let go of it, and you have  to accept your true work, or you've just been doing something that was really right for  you, and it was your true work, but now it's changing, and you're accepting a new  energy because you're now going to another level, or what you've been doing has  been your true work, but now you're really broadening it and extending it and  experiencing it on a whole new level.  \n\nIt's saying that it's very, very, very important for you to really get in touch with  experiencing that transformational energy and knowing that now is a time for you to  let go of your past and to really accept your future. You do this in a number of ways.  First of all, the first step in the Saturn cycle is figuring out what you really don't want.  It's almost as if you're in there cleaning out your psychic closets and you're saying,  \"Okay, well, I don't need this anymore and I don't need this anymore and I don't need  this anymore. I really don't need to let go of this energy. I don't need to hold onto this  energy. I can let go of it. I am going to let go of it, and I'm really going to accept a  new energy deep inside of myself.\"  \n\nThe next step is figuring out what you really do want. That's harder because it comes  in dribs and drabs. It's learning how to be quiet enough and open enough to accept  that energy. It's learning how to say, \"Oh, okay, I've really got to learn how to accept  this energy. I've really got to be open to accepting this truth inside of myself and  knowing that this is exactly the right energy for myself.\"  \n\nIt's slowly and surely getting in touch with the energy and learning how to be open to  that energy in a really good way. Now the third thing that happens with the Saturn  cycle is because the etheric body of adulthood, consciousness of adulthood is  actually connecting to your real physical body. You're really changing your  connection to other people who used to be adults to you. Your connection to your  parents can change because they're no longer your parents. It's like you are now an  adult. You are peers now.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Upbringing","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3346,3804"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"10th House: Placements in the 10th House refer to notions of life purpose, success, and social acknowledgement.

Children don't die. Even when they're  dying, they don't die. It's because they don't have a real sense of their mortality, but  adults die. All of a sudden, now, you're really confronting that mortality, and you're  grieving for the loss of your childhood. It's really easy in your Saturn cycle to  experience a great deal of grief, and you've just got to let it come right through you.  Also, you're grieving for the death of your parents no matter what shape your parents  are in. Whether they're alive or not, whether they're healthy or not, you're going to  grieve for their death because they're no longer your parents. \n\nYou realize that you are an adult, they're adults, they are dying. That's a real intense  energy for people to deal with. Another thing that happens is that you really have to  deal with your own insecurity because being in your Saturn cycle, it's really, really  easy to feel insecure. It's that feeling of like, \"Oh, everything's changing. I'm in a  kaleidoscope now. I want everything to be the same. I want everything to be secure,  and yet, somehow it isn't.\" One of the things you're really working on is you're really  allowing yourself to break through that insecurity. You're really, really allowing  yourself to know what it is that you have to do.  \n\nYou're really being able to say, \"Okay, I know that what it is that I have to do is really  accept the truth inside of myself. I know that what I have to do is really be able to  know that my only security is my truth, is my destiny, and I can't try to pin it on  anything else.\" It is an insecure time. It is a painful time, but it's also a time of  releasing the past and accepting your true identity.  \n\nNow the fact that Saturn will soon be moving through your 12th house. Right now, it's  still in your 11th house. It's a little bit of a respite, and it will start getting into your  12th house. Let's see, it has to hit 13 degrees. It'll be in your 12th house by your-- let's see, is it by [unintelligible 01:05:55]? No, it's by next October. It's October of  '81. It'll go back into your 12th house.  \n\nStarting in October of '81, you're going to feel as if circumstances are forcing you to  release negative energy, to release your limitations. It's almost as if this really strong  force comes down into you and takes this really high-powered flashlight, and is  looking in all the corners and under the bed and in the closets and saying, \"Okay,  now you got to really deal with this shit. You've got to really deal with this shit,\" yet it  affects you outwardly, externally.  \n\nAs an example, one person I knew who was going through this. Her lover was  someone she really didn't want to be with yet she was really holding onto it because  she didn't want to hurt her lover's feelings. Then when Saturn was in her 12th house,  her lover said, \"I don't want to be with you anymore.\" At first, of course, the woman  was feeling really frustrated and really angry.  \n\nThen she realized what a fool she was. It was like, \"Oh God, I feel relieved.\" This is  what you really wanted. It's that kind of energy where sometimes things happen, and  yet when they happen, at first, you might feel a real frustration or a real anger, but  then you realize it's exactly what you want it to happen. It's this thing of like, \"Oh, I'm  so pleased. I'm so thankful that this happened. Now I don't have to carry it anymore.\"  \n\nRealize it's starting in October of '81, you will be going through this period of time in  which external circumstances are forcing you to grow, and yet you know that that is  the best thing that could happen to you. You realize that all the things that are  happening, they're the things that you really wanted to happen, and yet at the time, it  might feel very scary to you and might feel very difficult to you. It's really getting in  touch with accepting that energy and knowing that that is absolutely the right thing  and that you really can accept it-  \n\n[END OF AUDIO]","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3804,4073"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Placements in the 12th House refer to mysticism, shifts in states of being or awareness, and (voluntary or involuntary) isolation.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

What that means is that when you  were born Cherrié, at the moment of your birth there happened to have been the  planet situated themselves in such a way that they actually formed these big shapes  in the middle of the sky. To have one is not super unusual but it's not that common  either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they're very important  because they tend to color everything else in the chart. \nYou have both a T-square and a Yod, and the T-square is caused because you have  two planets that were 180 degrees away from each other, so they formed this  straight line, the red line. Then you had another planet that was 90 degrees from the  other two, so it forms two right angles or a T shape in the middle of the sky. The T square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit  together. However, X can be anything, Cherrié. That X could be a relationship, it  could be money, it could be material object, it could be work, it could be the perfect  body. \n\nIt could be the perfect mind, it could be anything and X can change. You can decide  oh, oh, this is really X on Tuesday and then maybe by Thursday, you can say well I  thought about it again and I realized that's not really X, this is X instead. If you do  decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it,  for a while it really does make you feel complete. After a while it really gives you the  feeling of just like gee, this isn't quite right, it isn't quite working. You really feel oh I  have to go off and I have to find something else to fulfill me. \n\nIt's really analogous to going around and looking for wall outlets. You find an outlet,  and you plug your plug into it and the energy starts flowing through and you feel  really great and then all of a sudden you short out. Of course, the most normal thing  to do in that point is to pull your plug out of the outlet and to say, \"Oh what a stupid  outlet, it isn't working, I got to go find another outlet.\" What the T-square is saying is  that you do have the short circuit inside of you. Now the short circuit is caused  because you have an imbalance of energy. \n\nNow you're not doomed to the short circuit. It's not saying to you, \"Oh, well, tough  luck, Cherrié, for the rest of your life you're going to be like this.\" It's saying no, okay  there is an imbalance and you can write the imbalance. Now what the imbalance is  depends upon the particular planets in the T-square. Now in your case, you have a  special kind of T-square, because it doesn't just involve planets. It also involves  these two points which are called the nodes. Now the nodes, are not really planets at  all. \n\nIf you take the orbit of the earth around the sun, and then you take the orbit of the  earth's moon around the earth, those orbits cross in two places. The intersection that  faces north is the north node, and it points up, and it represents breaking away from  past life karma. The intersection that faces down is the self node, and it represents  getting sucked into past life karma. \n\nCM: Great.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=227,442"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: To have a T-square with the nodes first of all Cherrié it's telling you that this is  an old energy. That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, \"Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.\" What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it's just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.  \n\nWhat this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn't just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It's saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, \"Yes, this is who I am. I'm the power and what I want is right for everybody.\"  \n\nNow where's Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it's in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.  \n\nHaving Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that's the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn't start off  saying, \"Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I'm just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.\" It's saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.  \n\nAll right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you're breaking away is by seeing the truth that you're breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it's all illusions.  \n\nIt's not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It's telling you that you've been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It's not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You've already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don't have to see, \"Oh gee, what is power? I can't use it blah blah blah.\"  \n\nIn fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it's saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it's like, \"Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I'm  not here.\" Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, \"Who me, Cherrié? Oh no, not me. I don't know what you're talking  about. What power? I got no power.\"  \n\nYet at the same time, the people are there saying, \"Oh, Cherrié she doesn't have any  power.?\" It's like, \"What do you mean I don't any? Hey, listen, I have all this power  and I got to use this power. Here I am.\" Then it's like, \"Oh my God, what did I do?\"  \"Oh, no. No, I was just kidding. Just kidding, folks. No, I don't have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.\" It goes back and forth. There are some days in  which you're right up there, you're right there looking straight into your destiny and  saying, \"Yes, this is who I am, and this is who I have to be.\" Other days you're just  looking at that and saying, \"Oh my God, I can't possibly accept this power. This is  just much too scary. It's much too much. No, I can't deal with it.\"  \n\nIt is this duality of saying, \"Yes, I want it. No, I don't. Yes, I've got to have it. No, I  can't.\" What you're trying to do is to find the perfect balance, is to be able to be a  channel of that power, accept your power, but not feel that you have to take on too  much of the power and not feel that you can't accept yourself as you truly are. It's a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it's saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it. That's a really  important energy with the T.

First of all, it's the illusion that  you can use power any old way you want. Every time you get a little bit too egoistic  or too cocky with that power, you do get smashed. Every time you say, \"Oh, right.  Hey, I want this.\" You talk yourself into thinking, \"Oh, this is for everyone else, and  it's really for Cherrié and it's long, and it's like the neon signs go off and the sirens,  and it's like, \"Don, don, don, wonk.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"Whoops, okay, I'm not going to do it this time.\" The second side though, is  the more insidious side, because that part of the illusion is the illusion that your  negativity does to say to you, \"Oh, well, you can't have power. You're just too  messed up. You'll really misuse it. You can't touch it.\" The reason why it does that is  from your dark side's point of view, you're in this really terrible position because first  of all, it had power.  \n\nIt really had it, and you used it, and your dark side loved it because it had all this  incredible energy. It was like, \"Hey, I get to do whatever I want.\" Then you got  smashed. You really did get smashed. You went through a number of very painful  lifetimes, and your dark side lost its power. Now, here you are in this situation where  there's this power hanging right in front of you, and it's saying to you, \"Cherrié, use it.\"  You're there going, \"All right. I have to use it.\"  \n\nNow, your dark side is fit to be tied because it looks at this and it says, \"What do you  mean she can use it? This is mine.\" It's being taught, \"Uh-uh. You don't touch it. You  don't get near it. You can't even breathe on it.\" Your dark side's freaking out saying,  \"Well, if I can't have it, she can't either.\" It's energy, instead of trying to co-opt the  power, it knows enough now that it can't possibly co-opt the power. \n\nYou are in no way an evil person, and you're not going to be an evil person. It knows  it can't do that. What it figures it can do is to just keep you away from it. Because it  says, \"Hey, I don't want to get burnt. I don't want to get transformed. If I keep her  from being transformed, I'm going to not be transformed either.\" It's always in there  creating all these illusions about the power, saying to you, \"Don't touch it. Don't touch  it. It'll hurt you. It's bad. You can't handle it. You're not ready.\"  \n\nAll these things so that you'll step back and say, \"Oh, Gee, oh, I'm not ready.  Someday when I'm ready, I'll touch it,\" or, \"Oh Gee, oh God, this is so much and I  can't handle this.\" Or, \"Oh wow, what if I blow it? Everybody looks at me and says,  gee, Cherrié, we were really depending on you, and you really blew it. Oh God, you  really let us down.\" It's got all these really insidious ways to get to you that are so  subtle that they're not out front. You can say, \"Well, gee, I must be doing this from  the right thing. I just want to be ready. I'm doing this with a really good conscience.  It's not like I'm trying to mess things up.\"  \n\nIt also can get you through other people. It can say, \"Oh, Cherrié, you can't think  about yourself right now. You have to think about this other person or these other  people.\" Because then you can say, \"Oh, yes. Right. Well, see, I'm not being selfish.  I'm not being messed up. I have to go deal with this person, or this situation, or this  community, or whatever it is.\" It's telling you that you have to be really careful about  the illusions that your negative energy creates under the guise of positive energy.  The way you can tell is how it feels, because no matter what it sounds intellectually,  no matter how much you say to yourself, \"Oh Gee, really, it's got to be like this. It's  really got to be this way. It sounds really good in my mind. It's really creating it.\" If it  in your heart, you just don't feel good about it, you're just saying, \"I've got do this. I've  got to.\" Then you know, you've got to go with what your heart says.  \n\nWhat your negative energy does is it creates all this mental veneer, it keeps pulling  things up in your mind and saying, \"Cherrié, what about this? Oh, and how can you  think you're ready? Isn't that ego?\" Then you think, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:15:44], it  must be ego. I can't think I'm ready, so I'm not ready.\" Whereas it's all that energy  saying, pull her back. Pull her back. Don't let her go. Don't let her go.\" That's why  really accepting your destiny is really confronting that intellectualization of that power  as well. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=777,1051"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now every T-square has a point where it needs to balance because it is a T. There is  no planet on the chart because if there was a planet, then you wouldn't have a T at  all, you'd have a cross, which is a completely different energy. That missing planet is  called the void. It is directly opposite the stem. Your stem is in Taurus. Your void  then would be in Scorpio in the first house.  \n\nNow, the first house is the house of self-identity, and Scorpio is power. What this  says is that the thing that you really need to do is to identify with the truth of your  power. The truth that you are a divine warrior in this lifetime. I mean, you really have  to be. There's lots of things that you have to get out there and confront that Cherrie  and her Libra essence would rather not deal with it all.  \n\nYour Libras, there're going, \"What? Me? Oh no, not me. I'm just sitting here spacing  out.\" Whereas that Scorpio energy is right in there. It's going, \"You are a divine  warrior. You got to get out there. You have to clothe yourself in the truth. You have to hold the sword of truth and you have to communicate it. You have to be it.\" There's a  lot of parts of you that are in there saying, \"No, I don't want to look at this destiny  because it hurts. Besides it's scary. Can't I just stay here and live in a little house on  the ocean and not look at anything.\"  \n\nYou're being told, \"Uh-uh, Uh-uh, you got to get out there and confront.\" That's the  thing that's really scary, is that sense of, \"Oh, I've really got to get out there and  confront. I've really got to get out there and deal with the energy.\" The other side of it  is it says that you've got to really use that power that for many lifetimes you've been  sitting on it and really saying, \"I'm not ready, I'm not ready. I can't use it. I'll just blow  it again. I'll blow it again.\" This lifetime, you're right there. It's like your divine energy  has come right down to you and it's saying to you, \"Okay, Cherrie, this is the time.  This is it. You really have to use the energy. You cannot possibly ignore this.\"  \n\nYou're finding yourself having to really deal with that energy, having to accept it in  spite of yourself. Now, the fact that the Scorpio is in the void does not mean that you  don't connect to Scorpios. As a matter of fact, what it says is that at times Scorpios  can be incredible catalysts to your life. Because it's almost like their energy,  especially if their sun or any planet that they have fits into the void. It's saying that  then that energy really helps you to realize the T-square energy. Of course, Barbara  is a Scorpio. I don't know if her son, I can't remember what the degree of her son is,  so I don't know if it fits into this or not. Do you know what day she was born on-- November?  \n\nCM: I'm just forgetting. Oh, no. 17th.  \n\nAmy: 17th. There is a real good chance that her Sun would fit into this void.

Now you also have a Yod. Now a Yod is a partially  resolved T-Square. It's as if you've gotten a T-square and almost worked it out to  completion, but just didn't quite manage to get it totally synthesized, like in another  life. A Yod is called a Yod because actually Yod is the Hebrew letter for Y, and it is a  Y shape. You've got two sets of planets that are 60 degrees away from each other.  They form a 60-degree angle, then both of them are 150 degrees away from the  stem point.  \n\nIt's interesting that the stem point here is also Jupiter. Jupiter is the stem for both the  T Square and the Yod. What this says is that you have to be really careful at pushing  yourself too hard. It's like you've wanted to get through this karma so badly that  you've almost decided in past lives that you were just going to burn straight through  it. You had at least in one lifetime, I know of at least one in which you were just, ugh. You just decided, lay it on me Lord. It was just like, \"Okay, I am just going to totally  burn through this. I am not going to get stuck in this again.\" You did have, I don't  know if it was your last lifetime or the lifetime for it but it was incredibly painful. It was  very much involved in this intense victimization experience. Your death was a particularly incredibly horrible death where you died. You were raped and murdered  in your death and it was just this incredible thing [crosstalk] to sustain. Pardon?  \n\nCM: I was saying, why does it feel so recent? \n\nAmy: Recent? [inaudible 00:21:16] I'm with you. \n\nCM: When you said that, it felt so recent. \n\nAmy: Oh, yes. It was so traumatic for your soul. Yet, see, the thing that was so  intense about it is that in this really weird way, you engineered it because it was  almost like you said, \"Okay, that's it. Okay, maybe I victimized some people. Well,  I'm just going to burn right through it. I'm just going to rip it off my soul because I'm  not going to deal with this anymore.\" See, I feel like your misuse of power was  probably a number of lifetimes ago and you started off dealing with it more  intellectually, and you got very frustrated where you felt like, I have to get back to  using this power. I can't stand being impotent and not being able to use the power. \n\nWhat you decided to do was to just sear it right off of you and you had this life. It was  weird because it's almost like you didn't have to go through it. It's like you just got  this thing in your head that you had to release the energy and it's like you couldn't  realize that the way you had to release it was to forgive yourself. It was you couldn't  forgive yourself. You were so tied into this idea that somehow you were really evil,  that you couldn't just say, \"Hey, look, just forgive yourself. Let it go.\" \n\nIt was almost like in that lifetime, things just kept happening to you that were  incredible. It was almost like one of those catastrophic lifetimes where you just could  think, what next? How could something else happen to this woman? Yet you would  just keep walking right into it. It was like, this isn't hard enough. This isn't heavy  enough. I'm not going to be convinced that I'm released until I hit something really  heavy. \n\nFinally, when you went into that death, it was about the heaviest thing that could  possibly happen to you. It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing? You don't have to go through this.  Are you crazy? What it set up there Cherrie, is this real, almost like this intense self hatred because you felt like, \"I can't believe I did this. Talk about stupid.\" Then in this  lifetime, you have to forgive yourself doubly because not only do you have to forgive  yourself for the misuse of power but you have to forgive yourself for your ultimate  victimization.

Now, in one way, it's a good thing because It really  fuels your anger because you see that you bought it in that lifetime. You really  bought that woman bullshit of like, \"Oh, well, you're a woman and so tough luck.\" This is the way the world is and women were made to be stepped on and you really  bought it in that lifetime, and you really took it and you really embodied it.  \n\nOn one hand, there's a part of you that knows that and sees that, and it fuels your  anger. That's a good thing because you know it's like, \"I'm not going to take this  again and I'm not going to let other women take it which is a really good energy.\"  What happens is you take it really personally then and you say, \"Well, sure you are  really messed up.\" If you ever get taken advantage of, it's like reliving the rape and  the murder. It's like reliving that energy. Sometimes you're really confused at why  you take hurt so hard. Even if someone is just minimally hurtful to you, maybe they  don't even mean it.

You are not going to be like this now. Just be  strong. Be together. Why are you feeling like this? That person can't hurt you. Don't  let them hurt you.\" Yet, at the same time, there's this incredible pain that just washes  over you and this incredible feeling of hopelessness and of destitution and feeling  really alone and there is no way that anyone can help you or love you. It's almost like  just feeling that you're falling into this incredibly deep, dark pit. What that is, is that's  that woman in you that went through that, that still is experiencing it.

She just wants to let go.  \n\nShe doesn't want to have to be stuck there being tortured anymore. The thing that  you have to do is you have to release her because you don't need her anger  anymore. You needed her anger when you were a little girl because you needed it so  that you wouldn't buy into it and so that you wouldn't get caught up in the bullshit.  You needed it so that you wouldn't get stuck in all that Libra openness to other  people. She kept you. Every time you started losing it and started being too open to  other people or losing your integrity or losing your ideal, she was right there being  angry, saying, \"How can you do that? How can you let me down? They hurt you.  Don't let them hurt you again.\" She was really necessary but at this point, Cherrie,  you don't need her anger.  \n\nIf you buy into it, if you let her continue to make you feel the hurt and to make you  feel the torture, you're keeping yourself from being the power that you have to be  because not only does she have anger, she has fear. She's the part of you. It's  almost like she's this little personality inside of you and she's the part of you that  every time you start feeling really powerful shuts down because what happens is she  gets scared.

It just trickles and hurts and you get the pins  and needles. It's that energy where she's just gotten so numb that when she starts to  feel love, she freaks out. She just freaks out because it just hurts so much.  \n\nIt's the same thing with sexuality. It's like sometimes when you feel the most  openness in sexuality, you feel the most desire to shut down because it's the same  thing because in her head, you know, sexuality is bad. It's what got her in trouble. It  says, \"All right, you feel good about this. Well, listen, sweetheart, I'm going to make  you shut down.\" Sometimes after the most wonderful sexual experience, instead of  feeling good, you just feel awful because it's like opening up to that energy.  \n\nIt's really realizing that it is okay and you can forgive yourself and you can accept  yourself and things are going to be all right in this lifetime. That's like a really really  scary energy. It just feels so scary to you that you just feel like, \"Oh, how can I  accept this? I can't accept this. If I accept this, then what kinds of other things are  going to happen?\" That's why it is just so important for you to be able to let her go  and to be able to say to her, \"Okay, you don't have to guard me anymore. You don't  have to make me accept you anymore. You don't have to make it happen because I  know what I have to do and I'll protect you.\"","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Sexuality","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Relationships","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=1777,1974"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: The other thing you have to realize is, because your moon is trying your Pluto, you  have a really really strong guardian angel, and your guardian angel is right there to  protect you, to make sure that it's okay, to make sure that it's all right for you to  accept your energy, to make sure that it's okay for you to be who you really are. It's  saying that it's going to protect you, not just physically, but psychically as well. It's  really, really important for you to accept that psychic energy, and it's really important  for you to really trust that energy inside of yourself and know that you do not have to  take on the pain and you do not have to take on the negativity. \n\nThe key, as I'm going back to my original thing, is the Jupiter, because what that  Jupiter is saying is that in this lifetime, you just have to be very careful not to push  too hard. When you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, you have got to pull  back. There's a difference between just sort of normal fear and being overwhelmed.  The fear is just like, okay, you're afraid, but you still feel the energy. You still feel like  I've got the energy, I've got the strength, I've got the power, I've just got to go with it.  There's a difference between that and that panicky, overwhelming feeling of just like,  \"Oh, my God, I'm just exhausted, I'm drained. I don't have any energy. I cannot do  this.\" \n\nIt's really really important for you to know that you have to let go of this energy. It's  really important for you to know that you do not have to pick up on it, that you do  have to release yourself and feel the release because it's just a really important  energy for you, it's something you need to experience deep inside of yourself. Okay,  now, the other way that the Yod works is, okay, so then you split and you've got  these two battery of planets. First of all, you've got the moon conjunct to Mars. Now,  the moon is the intuitive, subconscious part of yourself and Mars is action energy. It's  motivation. Now, this says Cherrie, that you get guided intensely intuitively all the  time.

It's saying that you  really have to pay attention to this guidance. Now, the problem is that the guidance  comes intuitively and that it's really, really easy for you to block that intuition. It's  really, really easy for you to not connect to that truth inside of yourself at times,  because your sun is conjunct to your mercury, which means that Mercury's mental  energy sun is being-ness. You just accept your mind energy. Your mind really comes  in there and it really says, \"What are you talking about, Cherrie? What's this? What  do you mean, what are you talking about? How can you believe this?\" It's saying that  you pick up on energy all the time.  \n\nI walk into this room and you've never seen me before, and sure, your mind's going  to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's Amy, and she looks like this, and she does this  and blah, and blah,\" but your intuition is going to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's  Amy. Well, she's this, she's that. She said something.\" Nine out of ten times, you're  absolutely right with your intuition. The problem is that your mind comes in and it  says to you, \"What the hell are you talking about, Cherrie? You don't even know this  person. How do you know that this is going on?\" Especially because you don't just  do it about people, you do it about rooms and dogs and cats and books and  situations.  \n\nYou could walk into a room and maybe it's a beautiful room and there's all kinds of  nice people there. You say, \"There's a lot of tension here.\" Maybe someone with you  is saying \"Cherrie are you crazy? Are you out of your mind, everything's fine. What's  wrong with know?\" And maybe say, your mind goes, oh, yes. Boy, are you stupid?  [inaudible 00:35:39]. Then, you know, maybe three weeks later when a friend  comes to you and says, \"Well, Cherrie, you remember we went to that party and there  was this stuff. I didn't realize it, but there was all this stuff going on between so and  so and so and so. They just had this big fight, and they're not living together  anymore, and blah and blah.\"  \n\nYou're saying to yourself, \"That was the tension that I felt.\" Now, the problem is that  your mind has absolutely no conscience. That lots of times what happens is it says  to you, \"Oh, you're full of shit? What's wrong with you? You can't trust such and  such.\" Then when weeks later, you find out that such and such is true, your mind has  no qualms about coming back and saying to you, \"Cherrie, you knew that that was  true. Why didn't you do something about it? Oh, boy, you're stupid. I can't believe it.\"  It's the kind of thing where, see, your mind will switch sides. It doesn't care. It just  wants to be right.  \n\nThat's why it's really important for you to give enough credence to your own intuition  because you get guided so much. I cannot stress how much you are guided. You get such strong guidance energy, and yet at the same time, it's really easy for you to  negate that guidance. Lots of times it's like running around the rose bush. You go  around and around and around, and finally, you're so exhausted, you just give up,  and you just give into the intuition. Then you realize that you just should have given  into it a long time ago. You say, \"Oh, wow, this was right. What's wrong with me?  This was absolutely right. Why wasn't I trusting this energy?\"  \n\nIt is just really really important for you to make sure that you do trust this energy, and  you do know that it is absolutely right for you, and you do know that this is the right  energy, and you can give yourself a lot of support for what you're actually feeling and  realizing that that's exactly right for you. It's exactly what you've got to be feeling at  this time. The other thing that goes along with that is just the realization that you  really need to follow your hunches. You just get hunches about everything, and  they're really gut-level. Lots of times you don't follow them because you are scared,  because you think, who am I to have these kinds of hunches? Obviously, they can't  be true. They're not true.  \n\nThen in reality, you wish that you had followed them. Now, the moon energy is the  intuitive energy. It's also one of the female energies because it's the real mother  nurturance. It's like the goddess energy, and Mars Is the so-called male energy.  Because your moon is conjunct to Mars, it's saying that you really have to synthesize  your male energy inside of yourself. Because what happened after you went through  that rape and murder, I mean, obviously you just [unintelligible 00:38:31] to your  male energy. You just said, \"All right, that's it. I don't connect to it.\" The problem is,  that it's your male energy that holds your power.  \n\nYou've been trying to get it into your female energy, but your male energy isn't about  to let it go, not now, anyway. What you need to do is you need to synthesize your  male energy into your female energy. As long as you hate your male energy, you're  not going to be able to serve your power. It's really really important for you to accept  that male energy into yourself. Now, you don't have to term it male energy. It's just  the so-called male energy. It's just that power. It's that aggression, it's that ability to  really focus, to really deal outside of yourself. You have identified it as your male  energy in past lives. As far as you're concerned, you still identify it as your male  energy.  \n\nThat it's really important for you to really bring that back into yourself and get it to  really hook up with your female energy and get it to really hook up as a positive  energy. As long as you see that power as negative, as long as you see that power as  an ability to hurt, you're not going to be able to be 100% effective. It's really  important for you to draw it back into yourself and to really tie it up to your goddess  energy and really accept it in the depths of your soul.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mercury","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=2122,2487"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now, the other side of the Yod is that you've got Saturn, Neptune, and Venus all  conjunct, which means that they were so close together in the sky, they just lined up  together around the sun.

You have what's known as a  soulmate or a karmic mate. This is a person that you have been involved with in past  lives in many different ways. You may have been her lover, you may have been even  enemies, or parent and child, or teacher and student, or siblings, or colleagues, or all  kinds of things, and in this lifetime, you come together with the potential to be one  with each other on all levels, mentally, physically, psychically, sexually, emotionally,  spiritually, every single level you can think of, you have the ability to be one with this  person.  \n\nHowever, there is no way to tell if someone is your soulmate by what sign she is, by  what the person looks like, by what they do, by when you meet this person. There is  no way to tell by any external means. The only way to tell when a person is your  soulmate is by the fulfillment of different indications. There are also ways to tell  because this relationship is not a lot of things. It is definitely not in any way, shape,  or form an abusive relationship. It cannot possibly be an abusive relationship. It is  also not in any way, shape, or form a relationship that does not allow you to be your  true self. This person has got to totally support you in your true destiny, just as you  must support her in her true destiny.  \n\nNow one of the indications is the fact that you find you cannot separate from this  person, literally, physically. No matter how much you try to be apart, there is some  greater force than yourself bringing you together so that you find that you can meet  this person and maybe at first you don't feel a big thing. Maybe you meet this person  at a party or a bar or a conference or a meeting or something like that and you might  feel like, \"Oh.\" Somehow you're going to keep connecting to this person. It's like,  \"Look, Cherie, this is the person. This is it,\" which is why you can never meet the  person and then do nothing and then someday wake up when you're 85 and in the middle of the night and say  \n\nCM: She is the one. [crosstalk]-  \n\nAmy: -\"Oh my God, it was that birth and then I blew it.\" It's not like that. You get  chance after chance after chance, which is why even if you're together and you feel  like, \"Oh, fuck, I don't want to deal with this.\" Forget it. You find that you've got to be  there. You've got to work it out together. The second qualification is the fact that you are willing to put more into this relationship than any other relationship you have ever  experienced. This relationship forces you to go beyond your own ego and your own  sense of self and it's mutual. You are both working out this relationship energy, so  it's not like you can't do it. It's like you are forced to deal with it. You are forced to do it. You find that in spite of yourself, your head might be going, \"No way, Cherie, why  should you work it out? Forget it. You are not going to work it out,\" and your heart is  saying, \"You get in there and you work it out. You are not about to not work it out.\"  You find that you cannot help but work out the relationship. You find that you cannot  help but deal with this relationship in a complete way.  \n\nCM: It's terrifying. [laughs]  \n\nAmy: I know it is.  \n\nCM: Just saying.  \n\nAmy: It is. The third qualification is the fact that the relationship itself follows a  certain pattern. First, there'll be a plateau and everything will be very nice and very  easy and very lovely. Little by little, it builds up to some kind of crisis point. Now it  might be your crisis, it might be the other person's crisis, it might be internal, it might  be external, but it's some kind of crisis point. You find that the more you're able to  work out the crisis point, the more able you are to love each other, to be together, to  experience oneness with each other. Then it goes to another plateau until it builds up  to another crisis point. The amount of time between the crisis points depends upon  the couple.  \n\nFor some couples, it's every two minutes, and for other couples, it's every five years.  It just depends on what it is that you're working out. The fourth qualification is the fact  that you find it's really difficult to explain why you love this person. You can't explain  it. It goes beyond explanation. Cause you feel like, \"I love her because she's so-- No, that's  not it. It must be because she's-- No, that's not it. I think it's because of-- No, that's  not it.\" You find that you just cannot possibly explain it. It's just, it's so deep. It feels  so intense inside of yourself. You cannot explain it in any way, shape, or form. It's a  really deep energy. All you can do is really trust that energy and know that this is  exactly the right energy for you.

What you do after that its up to you. It doesn't say, \"Oh, and you'll live happily ever  after.\" You still have to work out the relationship. Obviously, for you, it's a very  intense energy because you do have a real struggle opening up your heart.  Obviously, this person is definitely going to open up your heart, and she is not going  to allow you to close down. The other thing is that it's really forcing you to let go of  pain around relationship. It's forcing you to work out sexuality, and it's forcing you to  open up to the truth inside of yourself. It's forcing you to say, \"Yes, this is who I really  have to be. I can not be anybody else.\"  \n\nNow the other thing it says is that with the Saturn conjuncture Neptune that in this  lifetime, you really have to use your healing energy in your work. Of course, you can  only do that when you experience love in your heart, and that you really have to experience a deep openness and a deep energy inside of yourself, and that you just  have to know that this is the truth, that you have really got to experience the truth  inside of yourself. You've really got to experience the knowledge that you are a  healer in this lifetime and that you're really meant to use the love that you're feeling  from other people to learn to love yourself, to learn to forgive yourself.  \n\nThe key here is self-forgiveness, it is self-acceptance, and it's the knowledge that all  you can do is really, really be open to this truth. All you can do is really, really be  open to what you know is true inside of yourself. Now Saturn, Neptune, and Venus  are sextile the moon and Mars. This is interesting because then Venus is sextile the  Mars, which is the union of the so-called male-female energy. It does say that when  they work together, you feel a real sense of completeness and openness inside of  yourself.  \n\nThen these are both in conjunct to Jupiter, which says that at times you feel a real  duality between that really active part of you, the real so-called male aggressive,  active, powerful part of you, and then the real victimization part of you so that what  you're trying to do is to switch energy. You're trying to get the male energy part of  you to experience nurturing, to experience love, to experience hope, to experience  transformation. You're trying to get the female part of you to stop being the victim  because that female part of you still really identifies with the victim. You need to get  her to feel strong, to feel strength to power, aggression, all the things that you want  to feel. You're switching the energy.  \n\nThat's what the Yod is talking about is the real switch of energy will allow you to  release yourself from that duality because it says at times, you really experience that  duality, and it is very confusing to you. Here you are, one day, you can be so strong  and so aggressive and totally like, \"No, I do not experience this pain inside of  myself.\" Then the next day, you can just totally fold in on yourself and experience  real victimization.  \n\nIt's very confusing to you because you feel like, \"What is going on?\" Of course, then  too, you're giving real mixed messages to people. Both I'm invincible, I am strong,  and I'm the complete victim. Then you're feeling like, \"What the hell? What kind of  credibility do I have that I'm expressing both of these energies?\" Yet they're both  there because they're both a part of you. What you're trying to do is to give power to  the victim and give compassion and love to the assertive part of you so that both of  them experience a synthesis and a connection inside of yourself, and that's a really  strong work that you're experiencing at this time.

It's painful because it's like  opening up a wound to the air, and yet it's the only way you're going to heal it. That's  the other thing I wanted to say. See because you feel such a need to be powerful,  you feel a lot of shame about the victim, and that's the thing that's really maybe the  most detrimental because you can't see yourself in shame. She herself felt an  incredible amount of shame. It's just that myth. It's that thing of, well, if a woman gets  raped, and if a woman gets heard, it's because she asked for it.  \n\nCM: It's also very Catholic and very Mexican, both of which I am.

Women are thought of particularly  around sexuality, so it's just like the clicks are phenomenon.  \n\nAmy: It's the kind of thing where you felt, so there's that real deep, deep, deep little  well of shame in there that when you start feeling like, \"Hey, I am a really strong  woman. I'm an incredible person. I am a divine warrior.\" That little voice goes, \"Oh  yes. Well, I'll tell you another thing. You are a real complete, total fucked up person.  You were victimized to prove it. On top of it sweetheart, it's going to happen again.\"  \nIt's that thing too. \"Don't let anybody get too close,\" because that goes right into the  lover thing. Here, if there's a person who really loves you and a woman who really  wants to give to you and really wants to totally accept you, then that voice comes up  and says, \"Oh yes, she's going to accept your shame, too.\" It's that feeling of like, \"I  can't let her in. I can't let her close because if she sees she'll be repulsed.\" She'll just  look at you and go, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:53:39]. How can I love that?\" There's that  hedge. It's that little wall you put around yourself and say, \"Oh no, oh no.\" It feels  very virtuous because it feels like, \"Well, I'm doing it for your own good.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"I know I'm a shamed woman, so I can't let you share my shame.\" Yet it's so  bullshit. As you said, it's so cultural. It's what we women have been experiencing for  centuries. eons. Also coming from where you've come from with the Catholicism and with the Mexican culture and then putting it on top of all the karma, it's right there,  and yet what this is saying is that you've just got to break through it. It's really  important for you to realize that you cannot feel ashamed of yourself. See, what  happens is then it gets twisted, and you start feeling ashamed of the power. \n\nInstead of feeling like, \"How can I be ashamed of being a victim? Hey, this is  something I bought into, and I'm not going to buy into it anymore.\" Then what  happens is that voice says, \"Oh, and you should be ashamed of the fact that you're  powerful too. What about all the women who aren't powerful?\" How dare you? How  dare you rub their faces in it? Then you feel like, \"Oh God. Nothing really that terrible  and horrible and disgusting has happened to me and I somehow escaped in this  lifetime.\" Well, it should happen to me, so I should feel ashamed that it hasn't  happened to me as fully as it could.\"  \n\nIt's really getting you both coming and going. That's why it's so important for you to  really release the shame and really allow yourself to feel good about the fact that you  are protected, that you are meant to be a warrior, that you are meant to experience  that power, and that you do not have to be victimized ever again in this lifetime. You  will not be victimized ever again if you choose not to be. That's a really important  karmic lesson for you.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Sexuality","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3173,3436"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Okay. The reason why this is coming up so strongly now is that you are starting about a six-year cycle. That is a very important cycle for you. It's like you started it  actually years ago. You started it about four years ago. You started this very important Saturn experience, and then you had a respite. You had a rest for about a  year, and now you're starting it again.  \n\nFirst Saturn in the sky as you know is continually moving. You happen to have all  this stuff back to back. As you can see, you have so many planets right here. Now  what happened is that you have Saturn, it passed over your 10th house. The 10th  house is the house of work, and Saturn rules work.  \n\nWhen Saturn passes through the 10th house, it says then that you really are  experiencing a real need to deal with your work energy. That was happening, I think  it was around '78. Let me just check. It started at 11 degrees of Leo. You started  experiencing it starting in September of '76, actually. You started experiencing it. It  continued until September of '79. That was over a three-year period. Then you had a  little bit of a respite. Then starting last September, so September of 1980, you  started experiencing it again very intensely, and you will continue experiencing it for  quite a while.  \n\nCM: Now, is that specifically around work again, or this is something [crosstalk]?  \n\nAmy: No, now it's something else. Okay? Now what you're experiencing is a number  of things because first of all, you have your sun in Libra. You also have Saturn in  Libra, and you have your ascendant in Libra. I know you have your ascendant in  Scorpio, excuse me, but your 12th house is ruled by Libra. Whenever Saturn passes  over the sun or Saturn or the 12th house, it creates a very deep experience. Now  your sun is in the same sign as your Saturn and your Saturn is in your 12th house.  It's like having three different cycles all back to back, all affecting you all at the same  time. That's a very intense energy for you. [crosstalk]  \n\nCM: It started in September?  \n\nAmy: It started in September. Now what it does is it affects you on all these different  level. First of all, it affects you with your sun. What it says is that you are then having  to confront all of your own limitations at this time, and you really have to deal with all  the limitations that you create inside of yourself. Also, you're in your Saturn return, and the Saturn cycle affects you in a lot of different ways.  \n\nFirst of all, one of the ways it affects you is that it really forces you to really let go of your childhood and to accept your adult energy so that all of a sudden, you, Cherrie,  are learning to be an adult in a total way. Now what that means is that you're  empowering yourself. You're really accepting your power and your identity on a  whole new level, on a level that you have never experienced before. It's saying then that you really need to deal with a lot of different issues with your Saturn cycle.  \n\nThe first issue is the issue of letting go of your childhood, which means that all of a  sudden, all these things that you have really associated with your childhood. All the  things that you haven't felt ready to deal with, you really have to deal with now. It's really connecting and confronting that energy. Really being able to look at it, really  being able to say, \"Yes, this is something that I really have to deal with. This is  something that I really have to connect to. This is something that I really have to  confront inside of myself.\" Now the second thing that's going on with this is the  realization that you also then have to deal with your work.  \n\nOne of the ways that we decide whether a person is an adult or not is by their work,  which is why obviously for so long women were never considered adults. [chuckles]  You are really looking at your work now and deciding what you're going to do with it. You've got three choices. Either what work you've been doing so far isn't your true  work, and now that you're in your Saturn cycle, you have to let go of it, and you have  to accept your true work, or you've just been doing something that was really right for  you, and it was your true work, but now it's changing, and you're accepting a new  energy because you're now going to another level, or what you've been doing has  been your true work, but now you're really broadening it and extending it and  experiencing it on a whole new level.  \n\nIt's saying that it's very, very, very important for you to really get in touch with  experiencing that transformational energy and knowing that now is a time for you to  let go of your past and to really accept your future. You do this in a number of ways.  First of all, the first step in the Saturn cycle is figuring out what you really don't want.  It's almost as if you're in there cleaning out your psychic closets and you're saying,  \"Okay, well, I don't need this anymore and I don't need this anymore and I don't need  this anymore. I really don't need to let go of this energy. I don't need to hold onto this  energy. I can let go of it. I am going to let go of it, and I'm really going to accept a  new energy deep inside of myself.\"  \n\nThe next step is figuring out what you really do want. That's harder because it comes  in dribs and drabs. It's learning how to be quiet enough and open enough to accept  that energy. It's learning how to say, \"Oh, okay, I've really got to learn how to accept  this energy. I've really got to be open to accepting this truth inside of myself and  knowing that this is exactly the right energy for myself.\"  \n\nIt's slowly and surely getting in touch with the energy and learning how to be open to  that energy in a really good way. Now the third thing that happens with the Saturn  cycle is because the etheric body of adulthood, consciousness of adulthood is  actually connecting to your real physical body. You're really changing your  connection to other people who used to be adults to you. Your connection to your  parents can change because they're no longer your parents. It's like you are now an  adult. You are peers now.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Upbringing","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3436,3894"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"10th House: Placements in the 10th House refer to notions of life purpose, success, and social acknowledgement.

Children don't die. Even when they're  dying, they don't die. It's because they don't have a real sense of their mortality, but  adults die. All of a sudden, now, you're really confronting that mortality, and you're  grieving for the loss of your childhood. It's really easy in your Saturn cycle to  experience a great deal of grief, and you've just got to let it come right through you.  Also, you're grieving for the death of your parents no matter what shape your parents  are in. Whether they're alive or not, whether they're healthy or not, you're going to  grieve for their death because they're no longer your parents. \n\nYou realize that you are an adult, they're adults, they are dying. That's a real intense  energy for people to deal with. Another thing that happens is that you really have to  deal with your own insecurity because being in your Saturn cycle, it's really, really  easy to feel insecure. It's that feeling of like, \"Oh, everything's changing. I'm in a  kaleidoscope now. I want everything to be the same. I want everything to be secure,  and yet, somehow it isn't.\" One of the things you're really working on is you're really  allowing yourself to break through that insecurity. You're really, really allowing  yourself to know what it is that you have to do.  \n\nYou're really being able to say, \"Okay, I know that what it is that I have to do is really  accept the truth inside of myself. I know that what I have to do is really be able to  know that my only security is my truth, is my destiny, and I can't try to pin it on  anything else.\" It is an insecure time. It is a painful time, but it's also a time of  releasing the past and accepting your true identity.  \n\nNow the fact that Saturn will soon be moving through your 12th house. Right now, it's  still in your 11th house. It's a little bit of a respite, and it will start getting into your  12th house. Let's see, it has to hit 13 degrees. It'll be in your 12th house by your-- let's see, is it by [unintelligible 01:05:55]? No, it's by next October. It's October of  '81. It'll go back into your 12th house.  \n\nStarting in October of '81, you're going to feel as if circumstances are forcing you to  release negative energy, to release your limitations. It's almost as if this really strong  force comes down into you and takes this really high-powered flashlight, and is  looking in all the corners and under the bed and in the closets and saying, \"Okay,  now you got to really deal with this shit. You've got to really deal with this shit,\" yet it  affects you outwardly, externally.  \n\nAs an example, one person I knew who was going through this. Her lover was  someone she really didn't want to be with yet she was really holding onto it because  she didn't want to hurt her lover's feelings. Then when Saturn was in her 12th house,  her lover said, \"I don't want to be with you anymore.\" At first, of course, the woman  was feeling really frustrated and really angry.  \n\nThen she realized what a fool she was. It was like, \"Oh God, I feel relieved.\" This is  what you really wanted. It's that kind of energy where sometimes things happen, and  yet when they happen, at first, you might feel a real frustration or a real anger, but  then you realize it's exactly what you want it to happen. It's this thing of like, \"Oh, I'm  so pleased. I'm so thankful that this happened. Now I don't have to carry it anymore.\"  \n\nRealize it's starting in October of '81, you will be going through this period of time in  which external circumstances are forcing you to grow, and yet you know that that is  the best thing that could happen to you. You realize that all the things that are  happening, they're the things that you really wanted to happen, and yet at the time, it  might feel very scary to you and might feel very difficult to you. It's really getting in  touch with accepting that energy and knowing that that is absolutely the right thing  and that you really can accept it-  \n\n[END OF AUDIO]","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3894,4163"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Placements in the 12th House refer to mysticism, shifts in states of being or awareness, and (voluntary or involuntary) isolation.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

What that means is that when you  were born Cherrié, at the moment of your birth there happened to have been the  planet situated themselves in such a way that they actually formed these big shapes  in the middle of the sky. To have one is not super unusual but it's not that common  either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they're very important  because they tend to color everything else in the chart. \nYou have both a T-square and a Yod, and the T-square is caused because you have  two planets that were 180 degrees away from each other, so they formed this  straight line, the red line. Then you had another planet that was 90 degrees from the  other two, so it forms two right angles or a T shape in the middle of the sky. The T square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit  together. However, X can be anything, Cherrié. That X could be a relationship, it  could be money, it could be material object, it could be work, it could be the perfect  body. \n\nIt could be the perfect mind, it could be anything and X can change. You can decide  oh, oh, this is really X on Tuesday and then maybe by Thursday, you can say well I  thought about it again and I realized that's not really X, this is X instead. If you do  decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it,  for a while it really does make you feel complete. After a while it really gives you the  feeling of just like gee, this isn't quite right, it isn't quite working. You really feel oh I  have to go off and I have to find something else to fulfill me. \n\nIt's really analogous to going around and looking for wall outlets. You find an outlet,  and you plug your plug into it and the energy starts flowing through and you feel  really great and then all of a sudden you short out. Of course, the most normal thing  to do in that point is to pull your plug out of the outlet and to say, \"Oh what a stupid  outlet, it isn't working, I got to go find another outlet.\" What the T-square is saying is  that you do have the short circuit inside of you. Now the short circuit is caused  because you have an imbalance of energy. \n\nNow you're not doomed to the short circuit. It's not saying to you, \"Oh, well, tough  luck, Cherrié, for the rest of your life you're going to be like this.\" It's saying no, okay  there is an imbalance and you can write the imbalance. Now what the imbalance is  depends upon the particular planets in the T-square. Now in your case, you have a  special kind of T-square, because it doesn't just involve planets. It also involves  these two points which are called the nodes. Now the nodes, are not really planets at  all. \n\nIf you take the orbit of the earth around the sun, and then you take the orbit of the  earth's moon around the earth, those orbits cross in two places. The intersection that  faces north is the north node, and it points up, and it represents breaking away from  past life karma. The intersection that faces down is the self node, and it represents  getting sucked into past life karma. \n\nCM: Great.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=137,352"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: To have a T-square with the nodes first of all Cherrié it's telling you that this is  an old energy. That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, \"Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.\" What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it's just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.  \n\nWhat this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn't just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It's saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, \"Yes, this is who I am. I'm the power and what I want is right for everybody.\"  \n\nNow where's Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it's in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.  \n\nHaving Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that's the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn't start off  saying, \"Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I'm just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.\" It's saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.  \n\nAll right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you're breaking away is by seeing the truth that you're breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it's all illusions.  \n\nIt's not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It's telling you that you've been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It's not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You've already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don't have to see, \"Oh gee, what is power? I can't use it blah blah blah.\"  \n\nIn fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it's saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it's like, \"Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I'm  not here.\" Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, \"Who me, Cherrié? Oh no, not me. I don't know what you're talking  about. What power? I got no power.\"  \n\nYet at the same time, the people are there saying, \"Oh, Cherrié she doesn't have any  power.?\" It's like, \"What do you mean I don't any? Hey, listen, I have all this power  and I got to use this power. Here I am.\" Then it's like, \"Oh my God, what did I do?\"  \"Oh, no. No, I was just kidding. Just kidding, folks. No, I don't have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.\" It goes back and forth. There are some days in  which you're right up there, you're right there looking straight into your destiny and  saying, \"Yes, this is who I am, and this is who I have to be.\" Other days you're just  looking at that and saying, \"Oh my God, I can't possibly accept this power. This is  just much too scary. It's much too much. No, I can't deal with it.\"  \n\nIt is this duality of saying, \"Yes, I want it. No, I don't. Yes, I've got to have it. No, I  can't.\" What you're trying to do is to find the perfect balance, is to be able to be a  channel of that power, accept your power, but not feel that you have to take on too  much of the power and not feel that you can't accept yourself as you truly are. It's a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it's saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it. That's a really  important energy with the T.

First of all, it's the illusion that  you can use power any old way you want. Every time you get a little bit too egoistic  or too cocky with that power, you do get smashed. Every time you say, \"Oh, right.  Hey, I want this.\" You talk yourself into thinking, \"Oh, this is for everyone else, and  it's really for Cherrié and it's long, and it's like the neon signs go off and the sirens,  and it's like, \"Don, don, don, wonk.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"Whoops, okay, I'm not going to do it this time.\" The second side though, is  the more insidious side, because that part of the illusion is the illusion that your  negativity does to say to you, \"Oh, well, you can't have power. You're just too  messed up. You'll really misuse it. You can't touch it.\" The reason why it does that is  from your dark side's point of view, you're in this really terrible position because first  of all, it had power.  \n\nIt really had it, and you used it, and your dark side loved it because it had all this  incredible energy. It was like, \"Hey, I get to do whatever I want.\" Then you got  smashed. You really did get smashed. You went through a number of very painful  lifetimes, and your dark side lost its power. Now, here you are in this situation where  there's this power hanging right in front of you, and it's saying to you, \"Cherrié, use it.\"  You're there going, \"All right. I have to use it.\"  \n\nNow, your dark side is fit to be tied because it looks at this and it says, \"What do you  mean she can use it? This is mine.\" It's being taught, \"Uh-uh. You don't touch it. You  don't get near it. You can't even breathe on it.\" Your dark side's freaking out saying,  \"Well, if I can't have it, she can't either.\" It's energy, instead of trying to co-opt the  power, it knows enough now that it can't possibly co-opt the power. \n\nYou are in no way an evil person, and you're not going to be an evil person. It knows  it can't do that. What it figures it can do is to just keep you away from it. Because it  says, \"Hey, I don't want to get burnt. I don't want to get transformed. If I keep her  from being transformed, I'm going to not be transformed either.\" It's always in there  creating all these illusions about the power, saying to you, \"Don't touch it. Don't touch  it. It'll hurt you. It's bad. You can't handle it. You're not ready.\"  \n\nAll these things so that you'll step back and say, \"Oh, Gee, oh, I'm not ready.  Someday when I'm ready, I'll touch it,\" or, \"Oh Gee, oh God, this is so much and I  can't handle this.\" Or, \"Oh wow, what if I blow it? Everybody looks at me and says,  gee, Cherrié, we were really depending on you, and you really blew it. Oh God, you  really let us down.\" It's got all these really insidious ways to get to you that are so  subtle that they're not out front. You can say, \"Well, gee, I must be doing this from  the right thing. I just want to be ready. I'm doing this with a really good conscience.  It's not like I'm trying to mess things up.\"  \n\nIt also can get you through other people. It can say, \"Oh, Cherrié, you can't think  about yourself right now. You have to think about this other person or these other  people.\" Because then you can say, \"Oh, yes. Right. Well, see, I'm not being selfish.  I'm not being messed up. I have to go deal with this person, or this situation, or this  community, or whatever it is.\" It's telling you that you have to be really careful about  the illusions that your negative energy creates under the guise of positive energy.  The way you can tell is how it feels, because no matter what it sounds intellectually,  no matter how much you say to yourself, \"Oh Gee, really, it's got to be like this. It's  really got to be this way. It sounds really good in my mind. It's really creating it.\" If it  in your heart, you just don't feel good about it, you're just saying, \"I've got do this. I've  got to.\" Then you know, you've got to go with what your heart says.  \n\nWhat your negative energy does is it creates all this mental veneer, it keeps pulling  things up in your mind and saying, \"Cherrié, what about this? Oh, and how can you  think you're ready? Isn't that ego?\" Then you think, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:15:44], it  must be ego. I can't think I'm ready, so I'm not ready.\" Whereas it's all that energy  saying, pull her back. Pull her back. Don't let her go. Don't let her go.\" That's why  really accepting your destiny is really confronting that intellectualization of that power  as well. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=687,961"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now every T-square has a point where it needs to balance because it is a T. There is  no planet on the chart because if there was a planet, then you wouldn't have a T at  all, you'd have a cross, which is a completely different energy. That missing planet is  called the void. It is directly opposite the stem. Your stem is in Taurus. Your void  then would be in Scorpio in the first house.  \n\nNow, the first house is the house of self-identity, and Scorpio is power. What this  says is that the thing that you really need to do is to identify with the truth of your  power. The truth that you are a divine warrior in this lifetime. I mean, you really have  to be. There's lots of things that you have to get out there and confront that Cherrie  and her Libra essence would rather not deal with it all.  \n\nYour Libras, there're going, \"What? Me? Oh no, not me. I'm just sitting here spacing  out.\" Whereas that Scorpio energy is right in there. It's going, \"You are a divine  warrior. You got to get out there. You have to clothe yourself in the truth. You have to hold the sword of truth and you have to communicate it. You have to be it.\" There's a  lot of parts of you that are in there saying, \"No, I don't want to look at this destiny  because it hurts. Besides it's scary. Can't I just stay here and live in a little house on  the ocean and not look at anything.\"  \n\nYou're being told, \"Uh-uh, Uh-uh, you got to get out there and confront.\" That's the  thing that's really scary, is that sense of, \"Oh, I've really got to get out there and  confront. I've really got to get out there and deal with the energy.\" The other side of it  is it says that you've got to really use that power that for many lifetimes you've been  sitting on it and really saying, \"I'm not ready, I'm not ready. I can't use it. I'll just blow  it again. I'll blow it again.\" This lifetime, you're right there. It's like your divine energy  has come right down to you and it's saying to you, \"Okay, Cherrie, this is the time.  This is it. You really have to use the energy. You cannot possibly ignore this.\"  \n\nYou're finding yourself having to really deal with that energy, having to accept it in  spite of yourself. Now, the fact that the Scorpio is in the void does not mean that you  don't connect to Scorpios. As a matter of fact, what it says is that at times Scorpios  can be incredible catalysts to your life. Because it's almost like their energy,  especially if their sun or any planet that they have fits into the void. It's saying that  then that energy really helps you to realize the T-square energy. Of course, Barbara  is a Scorpio. I don't know if her son, I can't remember what the degree of her son is,  so I don't know if it fits into this or not. Do you know what day she was born on-- November?  \n\nCM: I'm just forgetting. Oh, no. 17th.  \n\nAmy: 17th. There is a real good chance that her Sun would fit into this void. That  would just be an interesting thing because it would say that in her very essence  would help you to work out this T-square energy.

Now you also have a Yod. Now a Yod is a partially  resolved T-Square. It's as if you've gotten a T-square and almost worked it out to  completion, but just didn't quite manage to get it totally synthesized, like in another  life. A Yod is called a Yod because actually Yod is the Hebrew letter for Y, and it is a  Y shape. You've got two sets of planets that are 60 degrees away from each other.  They form a 60-degree angle, then both of them are 150 degrees away from the  stem point.  \n\nIt's interesting that the stem point here is also Jupiter. Jupiter is the stem for both the  T Square and the Yod. What this says is that you have to be really careful at pushing  yourself too hard. It's like you've wanted to get through this karma so badly that  you've almost decided in past lives that you were just going to burn straight through  it. You had at least in one lifetime, I know of at least one in which you were just, ugh. You just decided, lay it on me Lord. It was just like, \"Okay, I am just going to totally  burn through this. I am not going to get stuck in this again.\" You did have, I don't  know if it was your last lifetime or the lifetime for it but it was incredibly painful. It was  very much involved in this intense victimization experience. Your death was a particularly incredibly horrible death where you died. You were raped and murdered  in your death and it was just this incredible thing [crosstalk] to sustain. Pardon?  \n\nCM: I was saying, why does it feel so recent? \n\nAmy: Recent? [inaudible 00:21:16] I'm with you. \n\nCM: When you said that, it felt so recent. \n\nAmy: Oh, yes. It was so traumatic for your soul. Yet, see, the thing that was so  intense about it is that in this really weird way, you engineered it because it was  almost like you said, \"Okay, that's it. Okay, maybe I victimized some people. Well,  I'm just going to burn right through it. I'm just going to rip it off my soul because I'm  not going to deal with this anymore.\" See, I feel like your misuse of power was  probably a number of lifetimes ago and you started off dealing with it more  intellectually, and you got very frustrated where you felt like, I have to get back to  using this power. I can't stand being impotent and not being able to use the power. \n\nWhat you decided to do was to just sear it right off of you and you had this life. It was  weird because it's almost like you didn't have to go through it. It's like you just got  this thing in your head that you had to release the energy and it's like you couldn't  realize that the way you had to release it was to forgive yourself. It was you couldn't  forgive yourself. You were so tied into this idea that somehow you were really evil,  that you couldn't just say, \"Hey, look, just forgive yourself. Let it go.\" \n\nIt was almost like in that lifetime, things just kept happening to you that were  incredible. It was almost like one of those catastrophic lifetimes where you just could  think, what next? How could something else happen to this woman? Yet you would  just keep walking right into it. It was like, this isn't hard enough. This isn't heavy  enough. I'm not going to be convinced that I'm released until I hit something really  heavy. \n\nFinally, when you went into that death, it was about the heaviest thing that could  possibly happen to you. It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing? You don't have to go through this.  Are you crazy? What it set up there Cherrie, is this real, almost like this intense self hatred because you felt like, \"I can't believe I did this. Talk about stupid.\" Then in this  lifetime, you have to forgive yourself doubly because not only do you have to forgive  yourself for the misuse of power but you have to forgive yourself for your ultimate  victimization. That in a way is the hardest because you really have forgiven yourself  for the power.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Jupiter","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=1158,1437"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: You know except when you're really feeling depressed that you're not an evil person.  You really know that.

Now, in one way, it's a good thing because It really  fuels your anger because you see that you bought it in that lifetime. You really  bought that woman bullshit of like, \"Oh, well, you're a woman and so tough luck.\" This is the way the world is and women were made to be stepped on and you really  bought it in that lifetime, and you really took it and you really embodied it.  \n\nOn one hand, there's a part of you that knows that and sees that, and it fuels your  anger. That's a good thing because you know it's like, \"I'm not going to take this  again and I'm not going to let other women take it which is a really good energy.\"  What happens is you take it really personally then and you say, \"Well, sure you are  really messed up.\" If you ever get taken advantage of, it's like reliving the rape and  the murder. It's like reliving that energy. Sometimes you're really confused at why  you take hurt so hard. Even if someone is just minimally hurtful to you, maybe they  don't even mean it. There's a part of you that just takes it so into your heart and it's  so overwhelming to you, and you get really angry with yourself.  \n\nYou feel like, \"Will you just stop it? You are not going to be like this now. Just be  strong. Be together. Why are you feeling like this? That person can't hurt you. Don't  let them hurt you.\" Yet, at the same time, there's this incredible pain that just washes  over you and this incredible feeling of hopelessness and of destitution and feeling  really alone and there is no way that anyone can help you or love you. It's almost like  just feeling that you're falling into this incredibly deep, dark pit. What that is, is that's  that woman in you that went through that, that still is experiencing it. It's like every  time anyone hurts you, she relives it. It's like all she wants to do is die. She really  wants to die. She just wants to let go.  \n\nShe doesn't want to have to be stuck there being tortured anymore. The thing that  you have to do is you have to release her because you don't need her anger  anymore. You needed her anger when you were a little girl because you needed it so  that you wouldn't buy into it and so that you wouldn't get caught up in the bullshit.  You needed it so that you wouldn't get stuck in all that Libra openness to other  people. She kept you. Every time you started losing it and started being too open to  other people or losing your integrity or losing your ideal, she was right there being  angry, saying, \"How can you do that? How can you let me down? They hurt you.  Don't let them hurt you again.\" She was really necessary but at this point, Cherrie,  you don't need her anger.  \n\nIf you buy into it, if you let her continue to make you feel the hurt and to make you  feel the torture, you're keeping yourself from being the power that you have to be  because not only does she have anger, she has fear. She's the part of you. It's  almost like she's this little personality inside of you and she's the part of you that  every time you start feeling really powerful shuts down because what happens is she  gets scared. It's that thing of, \"Oh my God, they're going to do it to you again.\" She  just shuts down. She makes you feel this incredible panic, this incredible fear.

She just freaks out because it just hurts so much.  \n\nIt's the same thing with sexuality. It's like sometimes when you feel the most  openness in sexuality, you feel the most desire to shut down because it's the same  thing because in her head, you know, sexuality is bad. It's what got her in trouble. It  says, \"All right, you feel good about this. Well, listen, sweetheart, I'm going to make  you shut down.\" Sometimes after the most wonderful sexual experience, instead of  feeling good, you just feel awful because it's like opening up to that energy.  \n\nIt's really realizing that it is okay and you can forgive yourself and you can accept  yourself and things are going to be all right in this lifetime. That's like a really really  scary energy. It just feels so scary to you that you just feel like, \"Oh, how can I  accept this? I can't accept this. If I accept this, then what kinds of other things are  going to happen?\" That's why it is just so important for you to be able to let her go  and to be able to say to her, \"Okay, you don't have to guard me anymore.

It's  saying that it's going to protect you, not just physically, but psychically as well. It's  really, really important for you to accept that psychic energy, and it's really important  for you to really trust that energy inside of yourself and know that you do not have to  take on the pain and you do not have to take on the negativity. \n\nThe key, as I'm going back to my original thing, is the Jupiter, because what that  Jupiter is saying is that in this lifetime, you just have to be very careful not to push  too hard. When you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, you have got to pull  back. There's a difference between just sort of normal fear and being overwhelmed.  The fear is just like, okay, you're afraid, but you still feel the energy. You still feel like  I've got the energy, I've got the strength, I've got the power, I've just got to go with it.

Okay,  now, the other way that the Yod works is, okay, so then you split and you've got  these two battery of planets. First of all, you've got the moon conjunct to Mars. Now,  the moon is the intuitive, subconscious part of yourself and Mars is action energy. It's  motivation. Now, this says Cherrie, that you get guided intensely intuitively all the  time.

It's saying that you  really have to pay attention to this guidance. Now, the problem is that the guidance  comes intuitively and that it's really, really easy for you to block that intuition. It's  really, really easy for you to not connect to that truth inside of yourself at times,  because your sun is conjunct to your mercury, which means that Mercury's mental  energy sun is being-ness. You just accept your mind energy. Your mind really comes  in there and it really says, \"What are you talking about, Cherrie? What's this? What  do you mean, what are you talking about? How can you believe this?\" It's saying that  you pick up on energy all the time.  \n\nI walk into this room and you've never seen me before, and sure, your mind's going  to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's Amy, and she looks like this, and she does this  and blah, and blah,\" but your intuition is going to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's  Amy. Well, she's this, she's that. She said something.\" Nine out of ten times, you're  absolutely right with your intuition. The problem is that your mind comes in and it  says to you, \"What the hell are you talking about, Cherrie? You don't even know this  person. How do you know that this is going on?\" Especially because you don't just  do it about people, you do it about rooms and dogs and cats and books and  situations.  \n\nYou could walk into a room and maybe it's a beautiful room and there's all kinds of  nice people there. You say, \"There's a lot of tension here.\" Maybe someone with you  is saying \"Cherrie are you crazy? Are you out of your mind, everything's fine. What's  wrong with know?\" And maybe say, your mind goes, oh, yes. Boy, are you stupid?  [inaudible 00:35:39]. Then, you know, maybe three weeks later when a friend  comes to you and says, \"Well, Cherrie, you remember we went to that party and there  was this stuff. I didn't realize it, but there was all this stuff going on between so and  so and so and so. They just had this big fight, and they're not living together  anymore, and blah and blah.\"  \n\nYou're saying to yourself, \"That was the tension that I felt.\" Now, the problem is that  your mind has absolutely no conscience. That lots of times what happens is it says  to you, \"Oh, you're full of shit? What's wrong with you? You can't trust such and  such.\" Then when weeks later, you find out that such and such is true, your mind has  no qualms about coming back and saying to you, \"Cherrie, you knew that that was  true. Why didn't you do something about it? Oh, boy, you're stupid. I can't believe it.\"  It's the kind of thing where, see, your mind will switch sides. It doesn't care. It just  wants to be right.  \n\nThat's why it's really important for you to give enough credence to your own intuition  because you get guided so much. I cannot stress how much you are guided. You get such strong guidance energy, and yet at the same time, it's really easy for you to  negate that guidance. Lots of times it's like running around the rose bush. You go  around and around and around, and finally, you're so exhausted, you just give up,  and you just give into the intuition. Then you realize that you just should have given  into it a long time ago. You say, \"Oh, wow, this was right. What's wrong with me?  This was absolutely right. Why wasn't I trusting this energy?\"  \n\nIt is just really really important for you to make sure that you do trust this energy, and  you do know that it is absolutely right for you, and you do know that this is the right  energy, and you can give yourself a lot of support for what you're actually feeling and  realizing that that's exactly right for you. It's exactly what you've got to be feeling at  this time. The other thing that goes along with that is just the realization that you  really need to follow your hunches. You just get hunches about everything, and  they're really gut-level. Lots of times you don't follow them because you are scared,  because you think, who am I to have these kinds of hunches? Obviously, they can't  be true. They're not true.  \n\nThen in reality, you wish that you had followed them. Now, the moon energy is the  intuitive energy. It's also one of the female energies because it's the real mother  nurturance. It's like the goddess energy, and Mars Is the so-called male energy.  Because your moon is conjunct to Mars, it's saying that you really have to synthesize  your male energy inside of yourself. Because what happened after you went through  that rape and murder, I mean, obviously you just [unintelligible 00:38:31] to your  male energy. You just said, \"All right, that's it. I don't connect to it.\" The problem is,  that it's your male energy that holds your power.  \n\nYou've been trying to get it into your female energy, but your male energy isn't about  to let it go, not now, anyway. What you need to do is you need to synthesize your  male energy into your female energy. As long as you hate your male energy, you're  not going to be able to serve your power. It's really really important for you to accept  that male energy into yourself. Now, you don't have to term it male energy. It's just  the so-called male energy. It's just that power. It's that aggression, it's that ability to  really focus, to really deal outside of yourself. You have identified it as your male  energy in past lives. As far as you're concerned, you still identify it as your male  energy.  \n\nThat it's really important for you to really bring that back into yourself and get it to  really hook up with your female energy and get it to really hook up as a positive  energy. As long as you see that power as negative, as long as you see that power as  an ability to hurt, you're not going to be able to be 100% effective. It's really  important for you to draw it back into yourself and to really tie it up to your goddess  energy and really accept it in the depths of your soul.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mercury","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=2032,2397"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now, the other side of the Yod is that you've got Saturn, Neptune, and Venus all  conjunct, which means that they were so close together in the sky, they just lined up  together around the sun.

You have what's known as a  soulmate or a karmic mate. This is a person that you have been involved with in past  lives in many different ways. You may have been her lover, you may have been even  enemies, or parent and child, or teacher and student, or siblings, or colleagues, or all  kinds of things, and in this lifetime, you come together with the potential to be one  with each other on all levels, mentally, physically, psychically, sexually, emotionally,  spiritually, every single level you can think of, you have the ability to be one with this  person.  \n\nHowever, there is no way to tell if someone is your soulmate by what sign she is, by  what the person looks like, by what they do, by when you meet this person. There is  no way to tell by any external means. The only way to tell when a person is your  soulmate is by the fulfillment of different indications. There are also ways to tell  because this relationship is not a lot of things. It is definitely not in any way, shape,  or form an abusive relationship. It cannot possibly be an abusive relationship. It is  also not in any way, shape, or form a relationship that does not allow you to be your  true self. This person has got to totally support you in your true destiny, just as you  must support her in her true destiny.  \n\nNow one of the indications is the fact that you find you cannot separate from this  person, literally, physically. No matter how much you try to be apart, there is some  greater force than yourself bringing you together so that you find that you can meet  this person and maybe at first you don't feel a big thing. Maybe you meet this person  at a party or a bar or a conference or a meeting or something like that and you might  feel like, \"Oh.\" Somehow you're going to keep connecting to this person. It's like,  \"Look, Cherie, this is the person. This is it,\" which is why you can never meet the  person and then do nothing and then someday wake up when you're 85 and in the middle of the night and say  \n\nCM: She is the one. [crosstalk]-  \n\nAmy: -\"Oh my God, it was that birth and then I blew it.\" It's not like that. You get  chance after chance after chance, which is why even if you're together and you feel  like, \"Oh, fuck, I don't want to deal with this.\" Forget it. You find that you've got to be  there. You've got to work it out together. The second qualification is the fact that you are willing to put more into this relationship than any other relationship you have ever  experienced. This relationship forces you to go beyond your own ego and your own  sense of self and it's mutual. You are both working out this relationship energy, so  it's not like you can't do it. It's like you are forced to deal with it. You are forced to do it. You find that in spite of yourself, your head might be going, \"No way, Cherie, why  should you work it out? Forget it. You are not going to work it out,\" and your heart is  saying, \"You get in there and you work it out. You are not about to not work it out.\"  You find that you cannot help but work out the relationship. You find that you cannot  help but deal with this relationship in a complete way.  \n\nCM: It's terrifying. [laughs]  \n\nAmy: I know it is.  \n\nCM: Just saying.  \n\nAmy: It is. The third qualification is the fact that the relationship itself follows a  certain pattern. First, there'll be a plateau and everything will be very nice and very  easy and very lovely. Little by little, it builds up to some kind of crisis point. Now it  might be your crisis, it might be the other person's crisis, it might be internal, it might  be external, but it's some kind of crisis point. You find that the more you're able to  work out the crisis point, the more able you are to love each other, to be together, to  experience oneness with each other. Then it goes to another plateau until it builds up  to another crisis point. The amount of time between the crisis points depends upon  the couple.  \n\nFor some couples, it's every two minutes, and for other couples, it's every five years.  It just depends on what it is that you're working out. The fourth qualification is the fact  that you find it's really difficult to explain why you love this person. You can't explain  it. It goes beyond explanation. Cause you feel like, \"I love her because she's so-- No, that's  not it. It must be because she's-- No, that's not it. I think it's because of-- No, that's  not it.\" You find that you just cannot possibly explain it. It's just, it's so deep. It feels  so intense inside of yourself. You cannot explain it in any way, shape, or form. It's a  really deep energy. All you can do is really trust that energy and know that this is  exactly the right energy for you.

What you do after that its up to you. It doesn't say, \"Oh, and you'll live happily ever  after.\" You still have to work out the relationship. Obviously, for you, it's a very  intense energy because you do have a real struggle opening up your heart.  Obviously, this person is definitely going to open up your heart, and she is not going  to allow you to close down. The other thing is that it's really forcing you to let go of  pain around relationship. It's forcing you to work out sexuality, and it's forcing you to  open up to the truth inside of yourself. It's forcing you to say, \"Yes, this is who I really  have to be. I can not be anybody else.\"  \n\nNow the other thing it says is that with the Saturn conjuncture Neptune that in this  lifetime, you really have to use your healing energy in your work. Of course, you can  only do that when you experience love in your heart, and that you really have to experience a deep openness and a deep energy inside of yourself, and that you just  have to know that this is the truth, that you have really got to experience the truth  inside of yourself. You've really got to experience the knowledge that you are a  healer in this lifetime and that you're really meant to use the love that you're feeling  from other people to learn to love yourself, to learn to forgive yourself.  \n\nThe key here is self-forgiveness, it is self-acceptance, and it's the knowledge that all  you can do is really, really be open to this truth. All you can do is really, really be  open to what you know is true inside of yourself. Now Saturn, Neptune, and Venus  are sextile the moon and Mars. This is interesting because then Venus is sextile the  Mars, which is the union of the so-called male-female energy. It does say that when  they work together, you feel a real sense of completeness and openness inside of  yourself.  \n\nThen these are both in conjunct to Jupiter, which says that at times you feel a real  duality between that really active part of you, the real so-called male aggressive,  active, powerful part of you, and then the real victimization part of you so that what  you're trying to do is to switch energy. You're trying to get the male energy part of  you to experience nurturing, to experience love, to experience hope, to experience  transformation. You're trying to get the female part of you to stop being the victim  because that female part of you still really identifies with the victim. You need to get  her to feel strong, to feel strength to power, aggression, all the things that you want  to feel. You're switching the energy.  \n\nThat's what the Yod is talking about is the real switch of energy will allow you to  release yourself from that duality because it says at times, you really experience that  duality, and it is very confusing to you. Here you are, one day, you can be so strong  and so aggressive and totally like, \"No, I do not experience this pain inside of  myself.\" Then the next day, you can just totally fold in on yourself and experience  real victimization.  \n\nIt's very confusing to you because you feel like, \"What is going on?\" Of course, then  too, you're giving real mixed messages to people. Both I'm invincible, I am strong,  and I'm the complete victim. Then you're feeling like, \"What the hell? What kind of  credibility do I have that I'm expressing both of these energies?\" Yet they're both  there because they're both a part of you. What you're trying to do is to give power to  the victim and give compassion and love to the assertive part of you so that both of  them experience a synthesis and a connection inside of yourself, and that's a really  strong work that you're experiencing at this time.

It's painful because it's like  opening up a wound to the air, and yet it's the only way you're going to heal it. That's  the other thing I wanted to say. See because you feel such a need to be powerful,  you feel a lot of shame about the victim, and that's the thing that's really maybe the  most detrimental because you can't see yourself in shame. She herself felt an  incredible amount of shame. It's just that myth. It's that thing of, well, if a woman gets  raped, and if a woman gets heard, it's because she asked for it.  \n\nCM: It's also very Catholic and very Mexican, both of which I am. All the stuff that  you're saying, for me, it's just is so cultural too. Women are thought of particularly  around sexuality, so it's just like the clicks are phenomenon.  \n\nAmy: It's the kind of thing where you felt, so there's that real deep, deep, deep little  well of shame in there that when you start feeling like, \"Hey, I am a really strong  woman. I'm an incredible person. I am a divine warrior.\" That little voice goes, \"Oh  yes. Well, I'll tell you another thing. You are a real complete, total fucked up person.  You were victimized to prove it. On top of it sweetheart, it's going to happen again.\"  \nIt's that thing too. \"Don't let anybody get too close,\" because that goes right into the  lover thing. Here, if there's a person who really loves you and a woman who really  wants to give to you and really wants to totally accept you, then that voice comes up  and says, \"Oh yes, she's going to accept your shame, too.\" It's that feeling of like, \"I  can't let her in. I can't let her close because if she sees she'll be repulsed.\" She'll just  look at you and go, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:53:39]. How can I love that?\" There's that  hedge. It's that little wall you put around yourself and say, \"Oh no, oh no.\" It feels  very virtuous because it feels like, \"Well, I'm doing it for your own good.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"I know I'm a shamed woman, so I can't let you share my shame.\" Yet it's so  bullshit. As you said, it's so cultural. It's what we women have been experiencing for  centuries. eons. Also coming from where you've come from with the Catholicism and with the Mexican culture and then putting it on top of all the karma, it's right there,  and yet what this is saying is that you've just got to break through it. It's really  important for you to realize that you cannot feel ashamed of yourself. See, what  happens is then it gets twisted, and you start feeling ashamed of the power. \n\nInstead of feeling like, \"How can I be ashamed of being a victim? Hey, this is  something I bought into, and I'm not going to buy into it anymore.\" Then what  happens is that voice says, \"Oh, and you should be ashamed of the fact that you're  powerful too. What about all the women who aren't powerful?\" How dare you? How  dare you rub their faces in it? Then you feel like, \"Oh God. Nothing really that terrible  and horrible and disgusting has happened to me and I somehow escaped in this  lifetime.\" Well, it should happen to me, so I should feel ashamed that it hasn't  happened to me as fully as it could.\"  \n\nIt's really getting you both coming and going. That's why it's so important for you to  really release the shame and really allow yourself to feel good about the fact that you  are protected, that you are meant to be a warrior, that you are meant to experience  that power, and that you do not have to be victimized ever again in this lifetime. You  will not be victimized ever again if you choose not to be.

The reason why this is coming up so strongly now is that you are starting about a six-year cycle. That is a very important cycle for you. It's like you started it  actually years ago. You started it about four years ago. You started this very important Saturn experience, and then you had a respite. You had a rest for about a  year, and now you're starting it again.  \n\nFirst Saturn in the sky as you know is continually moving. You happen to have all  this stuff back to back. As you can see, you have so many planets right here. Now  what happened is that you have Saturn, it passed over your 10th house. The 10th  house is the house of work, and Saturn rules work.  \n\nWhen Saturn passes through the 10th house, it says then that you really are  experiencing a real need to deal with your work energy. That was happening, I think  it was around '78. Let me just check. It started at 11 degrees of Leo. You started  experiencing it starting in September of '76, actually. You started experiencing it. It  continued until September of '79. That was over a three-year period. Then you had a  little bit of a respite. Then starting last September, so September of 1980, you  started experiencing it again very intensely, and you will continue experiencing it for  quite a while.  \n\nCM: Now, is that specifically around work again, or this is something [crosstalk]?  \n\nAmy: No, now it's something else. Okay? Now what you're experiencing is a number  of things because first of all, you have your sun in Libra. You also have Saturn in  Libra, and you have your ascendant in Libra. I know you have your ascendant in  Scorpio, excuse me, but your 12th house is ruled by Libra. Whenever Saturn passes  over the sun or Saturn or the 12th house, it creates a very deep experience. Now  your sun is in the same sign as your Saturn and your Saturn is in your 12th house.  It's like having three different cycles all back to back, all affecting you all at the same  time. That's a very intense energy for you. [crosstalk]  \n\nCM: It started in September?  \n\nAmy: It started in September. Now what it does is it affects you on all these different  level. First of all, it affects you with your sun. What it says is that you are then having  to confront all of your own limitations at this time, and you really have to deal with all  the limitations that you create inside of yourself. Also, you're in your Saturn return, and the Saturn cycle affects you in a lot of different ways.  \n\nFirst of all, one of the ways it affects you is that it really forces you to really let go of your childhood and to accept your adult energy so that all of a sudden, you, Cherrie,  are learning to be an adult in a total way. Now what that means is that you're  empowering yourself. You're really accepting your power and your identity on a  whole new level, on a level that you have never experienced before. It's saying then that you really need to deal with a lot of different issues with your Saturn cycle.  \n\nThe first issue is the issue of letting go of your childhood, which means that all of a  sudden, all these things that you have really associated with your childhood. All the  things that you haven't felt ready to deal with, you really have to deal with now. It's really connecting and confronting that energy. Really being able to look at it, really  being able to say, \"Yes, this is something that I really have to deal with. This is  something that I really have to connect to. This is something that I really have to  confront inside of myself.\" Now the second thing that's going on with this is the  realization that you also then have to deal with your work.  \n\nOne of the ways that we decide whether a person is an adult or not is by their work,  which is why obviously for so long women were never considered adults. [chuckles]  You are really looking at your work now and deciding what you're going to do with it. You've got three choices. Either what work you've been doing so far isn't your true  work, and now that you're in your Saturn cycle, you have to let go of it, and you have  to accept your true work, or you've just been doing something that was really right for  you, and it was your true work, but now it's changing, and you're accepting a new  energy because you're now going to another level, or what you've been doing has  been your true work, but now you're really broadening it and extending it and  experiencing it on a whole new level.  \n\nIt's saying that it's very, very, very important for you to really get in touch with  experiencing that transformational energy and knowing that now is a time for you to  let go of your past and to really accept your future. You do this in a number of ways.  First of all, the first step in the Saturn cycle is figuring out what you really don't want.  It's almost as if you're in there cleaning out your psychic closets and you're saying,  \"Okay, well, I don't need this anymore and I don't need this anymore and I don't need  this anymore. I really don't need to let go of this energy. I don't need to hold onto this  energy. I can let go of it. I am going to let go of it, and I'm really going to accept a  new energy deep inside of myself.\"  \n\nThe next step is figuring out what you really do want. That's harder because it comes  in dribs and drabs. It's learning how to be quiet enough and open enough to accept  that energy. It's learning how to say, \"Oh, okay, I've really got to learn how to accept  this energy. I've really got to be open to accepting this truth inside of myself and  knowing that this is exactly the right energy for myself.\"  \n\nIt's slowly and surely getting in touch with the energy and learning how to be open to  that energy in a really good way. Now the third thing that happens with the Saturn  cycle is because the etheric body of adulthood, consciousness of adulthood is  actually connecting to your real physical body. You're really changing your  connection to other people who used to be adults to you. Your connection to your  parents can change because they're no longer your parents. It's like you are now an  adult. You are peers now.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Upbringing","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3346,3804"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"10th House: Placements in the 10th House refer to notions of life purpose, success, and social acknowledgement.

Children don't die. Even when they're  dying, they don't die. It's because they don't have a real sense of their mortality, but  adults die. All of a sudden, now, you're really confronting that mortality, and you're  grieving for the loss of your childhood. It's really easy in your Saturn cycle to  experience a great deal of grief, and you've just got to let it come right through you.  Also, you're grieving for the death of your parents no matter what shape your parents  are in. Whether they're alive or not, whether they're healthy or not, you're going to  grieve for their death because they're no longer your parents. \n\nYou realize that you are an adult, they're adults, they are dying. That's a real intense  energy for people to deal with. Another thing that happens is that you really have to  deal with your own insecurity because being in your Saturn cycle, it's really, really  easy to feel insecure. It's that feeling of like, \"Oh, everything's changing. I'm in a  kaleidoscope now. I want everything to be the same. I want everything to be secure,  and yet, somehow it isn't.\" One of the things you're really working on is you're really  allowing yourself to break through that insecurity. You're really, really allowing  yourself to know what it is that you have to do.  \n\nYou're really being able to say, \"Okay, I know that what it is that I have to do is really  accept the truth inside of myself. I know that what I have to do is really be able to  know that my only security is my truth, is my destiny, and I can't try to pin it on  anything else.\" It is an insecure time. It is a painful time, but it's also a time of  releasing the past and accepting your true identity.  \n\nNow the fact that Saturn will soon be moving through your 12th house. Right now, it's  still in your 11th house. It's a little bit of a respite, and it will start getting into your  12th house. Let's see, it has to hit 13 degrees. It'll be in your 12th house by your-- let's see, is it by [unintelligible 01:05:55]? No, it's by next October. It's October of  '81. It'll go back into your 12th house.  \n\nStarting in October of '81, you're going to feel as if circumstances are forcing you to  release negative energy, to release your limitations. It's almost as if this really strong  force comes down into you and takes this really high-powered flashlight, and is  looking in all the corners and under the bed and in the closets and saying, \"Okay,  now you got to really deal with this shit. You've got to really deal with this shit,\" yet it  affects you outwardly, externally.  \n\nAs an example, one person I knew who was going through this. Her lover was  someone she really didn't want to be with yet she was really holding onto it because  she didn't want to hurt her lover's feelings. Then when Saturn was in her 12th house,  her lover said, \"I don't want to be with you anymore.\" At first, of course, the woman  was feeling really frustrated and really angry.  \n\nThen she realized what a fool she was. It was like, \"Oh God, I feel relieved.\" This is  what you really wanted. It's that kind of energy where sometimes things happen, and  yet when they happen, at first, you might feel a real frustration or a real anger, but  then you realize it's exactly what you want it to happen. It's this thing of like, \"Oh, I'm  so pleased. I'm so thankful that this happened. Now I don't have to carry it anymore.\"  \n\nRealize it's starting in October of '81, you will be going through this period of time in  which external circumstances are forcing you to grow, and yet you know that that is  the best thing that could happen to you. You realize that all the things that are  happening, they're the things that you really wanted to happen, and yet at the time, it  might feel very scary to you and might feel very difficult to you. It's really getting in  touch with accepting that energy and knowing that that is absolutely the right thing  and that you really can accept it-  \n\n[END OF AUDIO]","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3804,4073"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Placements in the 12th House refer to mysticism, shifts in states of being or awareness, and (voluntary or involuntary) isolation.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

What that means is that when you  were born Cherrié, at the moment of your birth there happened to have been the  planet situated themselves in such a way that they actually formed these big shapes  in the middle of the sky. To have one is not super unusual but it's not that common  either, but to have two is considered highly unusual, and they're very important  because they tend to color everything else in the chart. \nYou have both a T-square and a Yod, and the T-square is caused because you have  two planets that were 180 degrees away from each other, so they formed this  straight line, the red line. Then you had another planet that was 90 degrees from the  other two, so it forms two right angles or a T shape in the middle of the sky. The T square gives you the feeling that if you just had X, everything in your life would fit  together. However, X can be anything, Cherrié. That X could be a relationship, it  could be money, it could be material object, it could be work, it could be the perfect  body. \n\nIt could be the perfect mind, it could be anything and X can change. You can decide  oh, oh, this is really X on Tuesday and then maybe by Thursday, you can say well I  thought about it again and I realized that's not really X, this is X instead. If you do  decide that a particular issue is X and you go off and you get it you really work at it,  for a while it really does make you feel complete. After a while it really gives you the  feeling of just like gee, this isn't quite right, it isn't quite working. You really feel oh I  have to go off and I have to find something else to fulfill me. \n\nIt's really analogous to going around and looking for wall outlets. You find an outlet,  and you plug your plug into it and the energy starts flowing through and you feel  really great and then all of a sudden you short out. Of course, the most normal thing  to do in that point is to pull your plug out of the outlet and to say, \"Oh what a stupid  outlet, it isn't working, I got to go find another outlet.\" What the T-square is saying is  that you do have the short circuit inside of you. Now the short circuit is caused  because you have an imbalance of energy. \n\nNow you're not doomed to the short circuit. It's not saying to you, \"Oh, well, tough  luck, Cherrié, for the rest of your life you're going to be like this.\" It's saying no, okay  there is an imbalance and you can write the imbalance. Now what the imbalance is  depends upon the particular planets in the T-square. Now in your case, you have a  special kind of T-square, because it doesn't just involve planets. It also involves  these two points which are called the nodes. Now the nodes, are not really planets at  all. \n\nIf you take the orbit of the earth around the sun, and then you take the orbit of the  earth's moon around the earth, those orbits cross in two places. The intersection that  faces north is the north node, and it points up, and it represents breaking away from  past life karma. The intersection that faces down is the self node, and it represents  getting sucked into past life karma. \n\nCM: Great.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=227,442"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: To have a T-square with the nodes first of all Cherrié it's telling you that this is  an old energy. That this is something that you have been dealing with for lifetimes  and lifetimes and lifetimes, and you finally get to it and say, \"Okay this is it. I really  have to deal with this energy.\" What the imbalance is about, is connected to these  planets because your Pluto-- now Pluto rules transformation and power. It is  conjunct, which means it's just totally together with right on top of your self node  which is past life karma.  \n\nWhat this says is that in a past life, you were extremely powerful and you felt that  your power was your work. It wasn't just powerful personally maybe you were in a  situation where you had a lot of personal power, but outwardly nobody saw it. It's saying that you were outwardly known for your power and that you got very  connected up to it because of the Leo in a very egoistic way. Instead of seeing  yourself as a channel for the power, you really totally identified with this power and  said, \"Yes, this is who I am. I'm the power and what I want is right for everybody.\"  \n\nNow where's Leo? Because the south node and the Pluto are in the sign Leo, and  the Leo indicates that it was a real ego attachment to that power. Now, you also  have this energy square to 90 degrees away from the planet Jupiter. Now, Jupiter  Cherrié is always a blessing except when it's in a square position, because in that  case because Jupiter is expansion it represents over expansion. It represents  something that once was good but has turned into too much.  \n\nHaving Jupiter there square to the Pluto in the south node, that's the fact that you  took on the power because you felt it was the right thing to do. You didn't start off  saying, \"Hey, wow, I want to have a lot of power. I'm just going to get in there and be  incredible and have all this power and do whatever the hell I want.\" It's saying that  you started off with very noble aspirations, but what happened is that the more  power you got the more you liked it and the more it felt like hey this is pretty good.  \n\nAll right, I must be pretty far out to have this power, and then the more you got in  touch with it the more you wanted it, and the more you got blinded to what was the  right balance the more you felt that you had to be the certain energy. Your north  node is in Aquarius, and the north node is the breaking away from past life energy. In  Aquarius, it says that you're breaking away is by seeing the truth that you're breaking  through illusions. Now, the key here is that it's all illusions.  \n\nIt's not just the illusion of power because you have really learned your lesson having  a really packed 12-house. It's telling you that you've been dealing with this power  issue for a lifetime. It's not like oh in your last life you blew it and now you have to be  real careful about power. You've already seen the negative side of the misuse of  power and been the victim now of a misuse of power. This has already happened to  you. You don't have to see, \"Oh gee, what is power? I can't use it blah blah blah.\"  \n\nIn fact, in this lifetime you have to reconnect to the use of power. You have to really  see that it is important for you to use this power, and yet what it's saying is you have  to use the power with the light in the truth, and that this is a very intense energy for  you. Quite naturally a part of you is scared shitless because you look at that power  and it's like, \"Oh, yes, I remember you. I remember what you were like, forget it I'm  not here.\" Naturally with the T, you feel this incredible duality, because some of the time you feel like, \"Who me, Cherrié? Oh no, not me. I don't know what you're talking  about. What power? I got no power.\"  \n\nYet at the same time, the people are there saying, \"Oh, Cherrié she doesn't have any  power.?\" It's like, \"What do you mean I don't any? Hey, listen, I have all this power  and I got to use this power. Here I am.\" Then it's like, \"Oh my God, what did I do?\"  \"Oh, no. No, I was just kidding. Just kidding, folks. No, I don't have any power. No,  no, no, no. Of course, I have power.\" It goes back and forth. There are some days in  which you're right up there, you're right there looking straight into your destiny and  saying, \"Yes, this is who I am, and this is who I have to be.\" Other days you're just  looking at that and saying, \"Oh my God, I can't possibly accept this power. This is  just much too scary. It's much too much. No, I can't deal with it.\"  \n\nIt is this duality of saying, \"Yes, I want it. No, I don't. Yes, I've got to have it. No, I  can't.\" What you're trying to do is to find the perfect balance, is to be able to be a  channel of that power, accept your power, but not feel that you have to take on too  much of the power and not feel that you can't accept yourself as you truly are. It's a  real connection to the truth inside of yourself. Yet at the same time, it's saying that  you cannot possibly ignore this power. You must deal with it. That's a really  important energy with the T.

Every time you say, \"Oh, right.  Hey, I want this.\" You talk yourself into thinking, \"Oh, this is for everyone else, and  it's really for Cherrié and it's long, and it's like the neon signs go off and the sirens,  and it's like, \"Don, don, don, wonk.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"Whoops, okay, I'm not going to do it this time.\" The second side though, is  the more insidious side, because that part of the illusion is the illusion that your  negativity does to say to you, \"Oh, well, you can't have power. You're just too  messed up. You'll really misuse it. You can't touch it.\" The reason why it does that is  from your dark side's point of view, you're in this really terrible position because first  of all, it had power.  \n\nIt really had it, and you used it, and your dark side loved it because it had all this  incredible energy. It was like, \"Hey, I get to do whatever I want.\" Then you got  smashed. You really did get smashed. You went through a number of very painful  lifetimes, and your dark side lost its power. Now, here you are in this situation where  there's this power hanging right in front of you, and it's saying to you, \"Cherrié, use it.\"  You're there going, \"All right. I have to use it.\"  \n\nNow, your dark side is fit to be tied because it looks at this and it says, \"What do you  mean she can use it? This is mine.\" It's being taught, \"Uh-uh. You don't touch it. You  don't get near it. You can't even breathe on it.\" Your dark side's freaking out saying,  \"Well, if I can't have it, she can't either.\" It's energy, instead of trying to co-opt the  power, it knows enough now that it can't possibly co-opt the power. \n\nYou are in no way an evil person, and you're not going to be an evil person. It knows  it can't do that. What it figures it can do is to just keep you away from it. Because it  says, \"Hey, I don't want to get burnt. I don't want to get transformed. If I keep her  from being transformed, I'm going to not be transformed either.\" It's always in there  creating all these illusions about the power, saying to you, \"Don't touch it. Don't touch  it. It'll hurt you. It's bad. You can't handle it. You're not ready.\"  \n\nAll these things so that you'll step back and say, \"Oh, Gee, oh, I'm not ready.  Someday when I'm ready, I'll touch it,\" or, \"Oh Gee, oh God, this is so much and I  can't handle this.\" Or, \"Oh wow, what if I blow it? Everybody looks at me and says,  gee, Cherrié, we were really depending on you, and you really blew it. Oh God, you  really let us down.\" It's got all these really insidious ways to get to you that are so  subtle that they're not out front. You can say, \"Well, gee, I must be doing this from  the right thing. I just want to be ready. I'm doing this with a really good conscience.  It's not like I'm trying to mess things up.\"  \n\nIt also can get you through other people. It can say, \"Oh, Cherrié, you can't think  about yourself right now. You have to think about this other person or these other  people.\" Because then you can say, \"Oh, yes. Right. Well, see, I'm not being selfish.  I'm not being messed up. I have to go deal with this person, or this situation, or this  community, or whatever it is.\" It's telling you that you have to be really careful about  the illusions that your negative energy creates under the guise of positive energy.  The way you can tell is how it feels, because no matter what it sounds intellectually,  no matter how much you say to yourself, \"Oh Gee, really, it's got to be like this. It's  really got to be this way. It sounds really good in my mind. It's really creating it.\" If it  in your heart, you just don't feel good about it, you're just saying, \"I've got do this. I've  got to.\" Then you know, you've got to go with what your heart says.  \n\nWhat your negative energy does is it creates all this mental veneer, it keeps pulling  things up in your mind and saying, \"Cherrié, what about this? Oh, and how can you  think you're ready? Isn't that ego?\" Then you think, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:15:44], it  must be ego. I can't think I'm ready, so I'm not ready.\" Whereas it's all that energy  saying, pull her back. Pull her back. Don't let her go. Don't let her go.\" That's why  really accepting your destiny is really confronting that intellectualization of that power  as well. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=777,1051"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now every T-square has a point where it needs to balance because it is a T. There is  no planet on the chart because if there was a planet, then you wouldn't have a T at  all, you'd have a cross, which is a completely different energy. That missing planet is  called the void. It is directly opposite the stem. Your stem is in Taurus. Your void  then would be in Scorpio in the first house.  \n\nNow, the first house is the house of self-identity, and Scorpio is power. What this  says is that the thing that you really need to do is to identify with the truth of your  power. The truth that you are a divine warrior in this lifetime. I mean, you really have  to be. There's lots of things that you have to get out there and confront that Cherrie  and her Libra essence would rather not deal with it all.  \n\nYour Libras, there're going, \"What? Me? Oh no, not me. I'm just sitting here spacing  out.\" Whereas that Scorpio energy is right in there. It's going, \"You are a divine  warrior. You got to get out there. You have to clothe yourself in the truth. You have to hold the sword of truth and you have to communicate it. You have to be it.\" There's a  lot of parts of you that are in there saying, \"No, I don't want to look at this destiny  because it hurts. Besides it's scary. Can't I just stay here and live in a little house on  the ocean and not look at anything.\"  \n\nYou're being told, \"Uh-uh, Uh-uh, you got to get out there and confront.\" That's the  thing that's really scary, is that sense of, \"Oh, I've really got to get out there and  confront. I've really got to get out there and deal with the energy.\" The other side of it  is it says that you've got to really use that power that for many lifetimes you've been  sitting on it and really saying, \"I'm not ready, I'm not ready. I can't use it. I'll just blow  it again. I'll blow it again.\" This lifetime, you're right there. It's like your divine energy  has come right down to you and it's saying to you, \"Okay, Cherrie, this is the time.  This is it. You really have to use the energy. You cannot possibly ignore this.\"  \n\nYou're finding yourself having to really deal with that energy, having to accept it in  spite of yourself. Now, the fact that the Scorpio is in the void does not mean that you  don't connect to Scorpios. As a matter of fact, what it says is that at times Scorpios  can be incredible catalysts to your life. Because it's almost like their energy,  especially if their sun or any planet that they have fits into the void. It's saying that  then that energy really helps you to realize the T-square energy. Of course, Barbara  is a Scorpio. I don't know if her son, I can't remember what the degree of her son is,  so I don't know if it fits into this or not. Do you know what day she was born on-- November?  \n\nCM: I'm just forgetting. Oh, no. 17th.  \n\nAmy: 17th. There is a real good chance that her Sun would fit into this void. That  would just be an interesting thing because it would say that in her very essence  would help you to work out this T-square energy.

Now you also have a Yod. Now a Yod is a partially  resolved T-Square. It's as if you've gotten a T-square and almost worked it out to  completion, but just didn't quite manage to get it totally synthesized, like in another  life. A Yod is called a Yod because actually Yod is the Hebrew letter for Y, and it is a  Y shape. You've got two sets of planets that are 60 degrees away from each other.  They form a 60-degree angle, then both of them are 150 degrees away from the  stem point.  \n\nIt's interesting that the stem point here is also Jupiter. Jupiter is the stem for both the  T Square and the Yod. What this says is that you have to be really careful at pushing  yourself too hard. It's like you've wanted to get through this karma so badly that  you've almost decided in past lives that you were just going to burn straight through  it. You had at least in one lifetime, I know of at least one in which you were just, ugh. You just decided, lay it on me Lord. It was just like, \"Okay, I am just going to totally  burn through this. I am not going to get stuck in this again.\" You did have, I don't  know if it was your last lifetime or the lifetime for it but it was incredibly painful. It was  very much involved in this intense victimization experience. Your death was a particularly incredibly horrible death where you died. You were raped and murdered  in your death and it was just this incredible thing [crosstalk] to sustain. Pardon?  \n\nCM: I was saying, why does it feel so recent? \n\nAmy: Recent? [inaudible 00:21:16] I'm with you. \n\nCM: When you said that, it felt so recent. \n\nAmy: Oh, yes. It was so traumatic for your soul. Yet, see, the thing that was so  intense about it is that in this really weird way, you engineered it because it was  almost like you said, \"Okay, that's it. Okay, maybe I victimized some people. Well,  I'm just going to burn right through it. I'm just going to rip it off my soul because I'm  not going to deal with this anymore.\" See, I feel like your misuse of power was  probably a number of lifetimes ago and you started off dealing with it more  intellectually, and you got very frustrated where you felt like, I have to get back to  using this power. I can't stand being impotent and not being able to use the power. \n\nWhat you decided to do was to just sear it right off of you and you had this life. It was  weird because it's almost like you didn't have to go through it. It's like you just got  this thing in your head that you had to release the energy and it's like you couldn't  realize that the way you had to release it was to forgive yourself. It was you couldn't  forgive yourself. You were so tied into this idea that somehow you were really evil,  that you couldn't just say, \"Hey, look, just forgive yourself. Let it go.\" \n\nIt was almost like in that lifetime, things just kept happening to you that were  incredible. It was almost like one of those catastrophic lifetimes where you just could  think, what next? How could something else happen to this woman? Yet you would  just keep walking right into it. It was like, this isn't hard enough. This isn't heavy  enough. I'm not going to be convinced that I'm released until I hit something really  heavy. \n\nFinally, when you went into that death, it was about the heaviest thing that could  possibly happen to you. It was like you just said, okay, this is what I have to go  through and yet it was very intense because while you were experiencing it, then you  got the truth. Then it was like, what are you doing? You don't have to go through this.  Are you crazy? What it set up there Cherrie, is this real, almost like this intense self hatred because you felt like, \"I can't believe I did this. Talk about stupid.\" Then in this  lifetime, you have to forgive yourself doubly because not only do you have to forgive  yourself for the misuse of power but you have to forgive yourself for your ultimate  victimization. That in a way is the hardest because you really have forgiven yourself  for the power.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Jupiter","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=1248,1527"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: You know except when you're really feeling depressed that you're not an evil person.  You really know that. Sometimes you get to a point, and you get scared and you get  depressed and you feel like, \"Oh God, I really must be fucked up for this to be  happening to me.\" Basically, it's pretty much all taken care of but the one about the  victimization is not taken care of. Now, in one way, it's a good thing because It really  fuels your anger because you see that you bought it in that lifetime. You really  bought that woman bullshit of like, \"Oh, well, you're a woman and so tough luck.\" This is the way the world is and women were made to be stepped on and you really  bought it in that lifetime, and you really took it and you really embodied it.  \n\nOn one hand, there's a part of you that knows that and sees that, and it fuels your  anger. That's a good thing because you know it's like, \"I'm not going to take this  again and I'm not going to let other women take it which is a really good energy.\"  What happens is you take it really personally then and you say, \"Well, sure you are  really messed up.\" If you ever get taken advantage of, it's like reliving the rape and  the murder. It's like reliving that energy. Sometimes you're really confused at why  you take hurt so hard. Even if someone is just minimally hurtful to you, maybe they  don't even mean it. There's a part of you that just takes it so into your heart and it's  so overwhelming to you, and you get really angry with yourself.  \n\nYou feel like, \"Will you just stop it? You are not going to be like this now. Just be  strong. Be together. Why are you feeling like this? That person can't hurt you. Don't  let them hurt you.\" Yet, at the same time, there's this incredible pain that just washes  over you and this incredible feeling of hopelessness and of destitution and feeling  really alone and there is no way that anyone can help you or love you. It's almost like  just feeling that you're falling into this incredibly deep, dark pit. What that is, is that's  that woman in you that went through that, that still is experiencing it. It's like every  time anyone hurts you, she relives it. It's like all she wants to do is die. She really  wants to die. She just wants to let go.  \n\nShe doesn't want to have to be stuck there being tortured anymore. The thing that  you have to do is you have to release her because you don't need her anger  anymore. You needed her anger when you were a little girl because you needed it so  that you wouldn't buy into it and so that you wouldn't get caught up in the bullshit.  You needed it so that you wouldn't get stuck in all that Libra openness to other  people. She kept you. Every time you started losing it and started being too open to  other people or losing your integrity or losing your ideal, she was right there being  angry, saying, \"How can you do that? How can you let me down? They hurt you.  Don't let them hurt you again.\" She was really necessary but at this point, Cherrie,  you don't need her anger.  \n\nIf you buy into it, if you let her continue to make you feel the hurt and to make you  feel the torture, you're keeping yourself from being the power that you have to be  because not only does she have anger, she has fear. She's the part of you. It's  almost like she's this little personality inside of you and she's the part of you that  every time you start feeling really powerful shuts down because what happens is she  gets scared. It's that thing of, \"Oh my God, they're going to do it to you again.\" She  just shuts down. She makes you feel this incredible panic, this incredible fear.

She's that part of you that can't let go, that just can't accept it. It's like  she wants to accept it so badly. It's like she's right.  \n\nThere's the river and she really wants to step over it and she's in there going, \"I can't  Cherrie, I'm too afraid. I'm too afraid that if I accept it, if I feel the love, if I feel the  positive energy, then it's just going to destroy me. Then they'll get me.\" Then they'll  say, \"Ah, we got you. We knew it. We knew that if you just relaxed and you felt good,  then we could really make you hurt.\"  \n\nShe just can't. That's why you think sometimes you're so crazy because sometimes  when things are the best, you feel the most panic-stricken because she's in there  saying, \"Oh God, I can't deal. It hurts too much.\" It's like if you've ever been out in  the real, real, real cold and it's so cold and you come inside, and you've just gotten  numb, and then you start feeling things. It just trickles and hurts and you get the pins  and needles. It's that energy where she's just gotten so numb that when she starts to  feel love, she freaks out. She just freaks out because it just hurts so much.  \n\nIt's the same thing with sexuality. It's like sometimes when you feel the most  openness in sexuality, you feel the most desire to shut down because it's the same  thing because in her head, you know, sexuality is bad. It's what got her in trouble. It  says, \"All right, you feel good about this. Well, listen, sweetheart, I'm going to make  you shut down.\" Sometimes after the most wonderful sexual experience, instead of  feeling good, you just feel awful because it's like opening up to that energy.  \n\nIt's really realizing that it is okay and you can forgive yourself and you can accept  yourself and things are going to be all right in this lifetime. That's like a really really  scary energy. It just feels so scary to you that you just feel like, \"Oh, how can I  accept this? I can't accept this. If I accept this, then what kinds of other things are  going to happen?\" That's why it is just so important for you to be able to let her go  and to be able to say to her, \"Okay, you don't have to guard me anymore.

It's  saying that it's going to protect you, not just physically, but psychically as well. It's  really, really important for you to accept that psychic energy, and it's really important  for you to really trust that energy inside of yourself and know that you do not have to  take on the pain and you do not have to take on the negativity. \n\nThe key, as I'm going back to my original thing, is the Jupiter, because what that  Jupiter is saying is that in this lifetime, you just have to be very careful not to push  too hard. When you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, you have got to pull  back. There's a difference between just sort of normal fear and being overwhelmed.  The fear is just like, okay, you're afraid, but you still feel the energy. You still feel like  I've got the energy, I've got the strength, I've got the power, I've just got to go with it.  There's a difference between that and that panicky, overwhelming feeling of just like,  \"Oh, my God, I'm just exhausted, I'm drained. I don't have any energy. I cannot do  this.\" \n\nIt's really really important for you to know that you have to let go of this energy. It's  really important for you to know that you do not have to pick up on it, that you do  have to release yourself and feel the release because it's just a really important  energy for you, it's something you need to experience deep inside of yourself. Okay,  now, the other way that the Yod works is, okay, so then you split and you've got  these two battery of planets. First of all, you've got the moon conjunct to Mars. Now,  the moon is the intuitive, subconscious part of yourself and Mars is action energy. It's  motivation. Now, this says Cherrie, that you get guided intensely intuitively all the  time.

It's saying that you  really have to pay attention to this guidance. Now, the problem is that the guidance  comes intuitively and that it's really, really easy for you to block that intuition. It's  really, really easy for you to not connect to that truth inside of yourself at times,  because your sun is conjunct to your mercury, which means that Mercury's mental  energy sun is being-ness. You just accept your mind energy. Your mind really comes  in there and it really says, \"What are you talking about, Cherrie? What's this? What  do you mean, what are you talking about? How can you believe this?\" It's saying that  you pick up on energy all the time.  \n\nI walk into this room and you've never seen me before, and sure, your mind's going  to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's Amy, and she looks like this, and she does this  and blah, and blah,\" but your intuition is going to look at me and say, \"Oh, so that's  Amy. Well, she's this, she's that. She said something.\" Nine out of ten times, you're  absolutely right with your intuition. The problem is that your mind comes in and it  says to you, \"What the hell are you talking about, Cherrie? You don't even know this  person. How do you know that this is going on?\" Especially because you don't just  do it about people, you do it about rooms and dogs and cats and books and  situations.  \n\nYou could walk into a room and maybe it's a beautiful room and there's all kinds of  nice people there. You say, \"There's a lot of tension here.\" Maybe someone with you  is saying \"Cherrie are you crazy? Are you out of your mind, everything's fine. What's  wrong with know?\" And maybe say, your mind goes, oh, yes. Boy, are you stupid?  [inaudible 00:35:39]. Then, you know, maybe three weeks later when a friend  comes to you and says, \"Well, Cherrie, you remember we went to that party and there  was this stuff. I didn't realize it, but there was all this stuff going on between so and  so and so and so. They just had this big fight, and they're not living together  anymore, and blah and blah.\"  \n\nYou're saying to yourself, \"That was the tension that I felt.\" Now, the problem is that  your mind has absolutely no conscience. That lots of times what happens is it says  to you, \"Oh, you're full of shit? What's wrong with you? You can't trust such and  such.\" Then when weeks later, you find out that such and such is true, your mind has  no qualms about coming back and saying to you, \"Cherrie, you knew that that was  true. Why didn't you do something about it? Oh, boy, you're stupid. I can't believe it.\"  It's the kind of thing where, see, your mind will switch sides. It doesn't care. It just  wants to be right.  \n\nThat's why it's really important for you to give enough credence to your own intuition  because you get guided so much. I cannot stress how much you are guided. You get such strong guidance energy, and yet at the same time, it's really easy for you to  negate that guidance. Lots of times it's like running around the rose bush. You go  around and around and around, and finally, you're so exhausted, you just give up,  and you just give into the intuition. Then you realize that you just should have given  into it a long time ago. You say, \"Oh, wow, this was right. What's wrong with me?  This was absolutely right. Why wasn't I trusting this energy?\"  \n\nIt is just really really important for you to make sure that you do trust this energy, and  you do know that it is absolutely right for you, and you do know that this is the right  energy, and you can give yourself a lot of support for what you're actually feeling and  realizing that that's exactly right for you. It's exactly what you've got to be feeling at  this time. The other thing that goes along with that is just the realization that you  really need to follow your hunches. You just get hunches about everything, and  they're really gut-level. Lots of times you don't follow them because you are scared,  because you think, who am I to have these kinds of hunches? Obviously, they can't  be true. They're not true.  \n\nThen in reality, you wish that you had followed them. Now, the moon energy is the  intuitive energy. It's also one of the female energies because it's the real mother  nurturance. It's like the goddess energy, and Mars Is the so-called male energy.  Because your moon is conjunct to Mars, it's saying that you really have to synthesize  your male energy inside of yourself. Because what happened after you went through  that rape and murder, I mean, obviously you just [unintelligible 00:38:31] to your  male energy. You just said, \"All right, that's it. I don't connect to it.\" The problem is,  that it's your male energy that holds your power.  \n\nYou've been trying to get it into your female energy, but your male energy isn't about  to let it go, not now, anyway. What you need to do is you need to synthesize your  male energy into your female energy. As long as you hate your male energy, you're  not going to be able to serve your power. It's really really important for you to accept  that male energy into yourself. Now, you don't have to term it male energy. It's just  the so-called male energy. It's just that power. It's that aggression, it's that ability to  really focus, to really deal outside of yourself. You have identified it as your male  energy in past lives. As far as you're concerned, you still identify it as your male  energy.  \n\nThat it's really important for you to really bring that back into yourself and get it to  really hook up with your female energy and get it to really hook up as a positive  energy. As long as you see that power as negative, as long as you see that power as  an ability to hurt, you're not going to be able to be 100% effective. It's really  important for you to draw it back into yourself and to really tie it up to your goddess  energy and really accept it in the depths of your soul.\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mercury","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=2122,2487"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Amy: Now, the other side of the Yod is that you've got Saturn, Neptune, and Venus all  conjunct, which means that they were so close together in the sky, they just lined up  together around the sun.

Now this does a lot of different things. First of  all, one of the things that it does is it says that you really are working out still a lot of  karma around relationships.

You have what's known as a  soulmate or a karmic mate. This is a person that you have been involved with in past  lives in many different ways. You may have been her lover, you may have been even  enemies, or parent and child, or teacher and student, or siblings, or colleagues, or all  kinds of things, and in this lifetime, you come together with the potential to be one  with each other on all levels, mentally, physically, psychically, sexually, emotionally,  spiritually, every single level you can think of, you have the ability to be one with this  person.  \n\nHowever, there is no way to tell if someone is your soulmate by what sign she is, by  what the person looks like, by what they do, by when you meet this person. There is  no way to tell by any external means. The only way to tell when a person is your  soulmate is by the fulfillment of different indications. There are also ways to tell  because this relationship is not a lot of things. It is definitely not in any way, shape,  or form an abusive relationship. It cannot possibly be an abusive relationship. It is  also not in any way, shape, or form a relationship that does not allow you to be your  true self. This person has got to totally support you in your true destiny, just as you  must support her in her true destiny.  \n\nNow one of the indications is the fact that you find you cannot separate from this  person, literally, physically. No matter how much you try to be apart, there is some  greater force than yourself bringing you together so that you find that you can meet  this person and maybe at first you don't feel a big thing. Maybe you meet this person  at a party or a bar or a conference or a meeting or something like that and you might  feel like, \"Oh.\" Somehow you're going to keep connecting to this person. It's like,  \"Look, Cherie, this is the person. This is it,\" which is why you can never meet the  person and then do nothing and then someday wake up when you're 85 and in the middle of the night and say  \n\nCM: She is the one. [crosstalk]-  \n\nAmy: -\"Oh my God, it was that birth and then I blew it.\" It's not like that. You get  chance after chance after chance, which is why even if you're together and you feel  like, \"Oh, fuck, I don't want to deal with this.\" Forget it. You find that you've got to be  there. You've got to work it out together. The second qualification is the fact that you are willing to put more into this relationship than any other relationship you have ever  experienced. This relationship forces you to go beyond your own ego and your own  sense of self and it's mutual. You are both working out this relationship energy, so  it's not like you can't do it. It's like you are forced to deal with it. You are forced to do it. You find that in spite of yourself, your head might be going, \"No way, Cherie, why  should you work it out? Forget it. You are not going to work it out,\" and your heart is  saying, \"You get in there and you work it out. You are not about to not work it out.\"  You find that you cannot help but work out the relationship. You find that you cannot  help but deal with this relationship in a complete way.  \n\nCM: It's terrifying. [laughs]  \n\nAmy: I know it is.  \n\nCM: Just saying.  \n\nAmy: It is. The third qualification is the fact that the relationship itself follows a  certain pattern. First, there'll be a plateau and everything will be very nice and very  easy and very lovely. Little by little, it builds up to some kind of crisis point. Now it  might be your crisis, it might be the other person's crisis, it might be internal, it might  be external, but it's some kind of crisis point. You find that the more you're able to  work out the crisis point, the more able you are to love each other, to be together, to  experience oneness with each other. Then it goes to another plateau until it builds up  to another crisis point. The amount of time between the crisis points depends upon  the couple.  \n\nFor some couples, it's every two minutes, and for other couples, it's every five years.  It just depends on what it is that you're working out. The fourth qualification is the fact  that you find it's really difficult to explain why you love this person. You can't explain  it. It goes beyond explanation. Cause you feel like, \"I love her because she's so-- No, that's  not it. It must be because she's-- No, that's not it. I think it's because of-- No, that's  not it.\" You find that you just cannot possibly explain it. It's just, it's so deep. It feels  so intense inside of yourself. You cannot explain it in any way, shape, or form. It's a  really deep energy. All you can do is really trust that energy and know that this is  exactly the right energy for you.

What you do after that its up to you. It doesn't say, \"Oh, and you'll live happily ever  after.\" You still have to work out the relationship. Obviously, for you, it's a very  intense energy because you do have a real struggle opening up your heart.  Obviously, this person is definitely going to open up your heart, and she is not going  to allow you to close down. The other thing is that it's really forcing you to let go of  pain around relationship. It's forcing you to work out sexuality, and it's forcing you to  open up to the truth inside of yourself. It's forcing you to say, \"Yes, this is who I really  have to be. I can not be anybody else.\"  \n\nNow the other thing it says is that with the Saturn conjuncture Neptune that in this  lifetime, you really have to use your healing energy in your work. Of course, you can  only do that when you experience love in your heart, and that you really have to experience a deep openness and a deep energy inside of yourself, and that you just  have to know that this is the truth, that you have really got to experience the truth  inside of yourself. You've really got to experience the knowledge that you are a  healer in this lifetime and that you're really meant to use the love that you're feeling  from other people to learn to love yourself, to learn to forgive yourself.  \n\nThe key here is self-forgiveness, it is self-acceptance, and it's the knowledge that all  you can do is really, really be open to this truth. All you can do is really, really be  open to what you know is true inside of yourself. Now Saturn, Neptune, and Venus  are sextile the moon and Mars. This is interesting because then Venus is sextile the  Mars, which is the union of the so-called male-female energy. It does say that when  they work together, you feel a real sense of completeness and openness inside of  yourself.  \n\nThen these are both in conjunct to Jupiter, which says that at times you feel a real  duality between that really active part of you, the real so-called male aggressive,  active, powerful part of you, and then the real victimization part of you so that what  you're trying to do is to switch energy. You're trying to get the male energy part of  you to experience nurturing, to experience love, to experience hope, to experience  transformation. You're trying to get the female part of you to stop being the victim  because that female part of you still really identifies with the victim. You need to get  her to feel strong, to feel strength to power, aggression, all the things that you want  to feel. You're switching the energy.  \n\nThat's what the Yod is talking about is the real switch of energy will allow you to  release yourself from that duality because it says at times, you really experience that  duality, and it is very confusing to you. Here you are, one day, you can be so strong  and so aggressive and totally like, \"No, I do not experience this pain inside of  myself.\" Then the next day, you can just totally fold in on yourself and experience  real victimization.  \n\nIt's very confusing to you because you feel like, \"What is going on?\" Of course, then  too, you're giving real mixed messages to people. Both I'm invincible, I am strong,  and I'm the complete victim. Then you're feeling like, \"What the hell? What kind of  credibility do I have that I'm expressing both of these energies?\" Yet they're both  there because they're both a part of you. What you're trying to do is to give power to  the victim and give compassion and love to the assertive part of you so that both of  them experience a synthesis and a connection inside of yourself, and that's a really  strong work that you're experiencing at this time.

It's painful because it's like  opening up a wound to the air, and yet it's the only way you're going to heal it. That's  the other thing I wanted to say. See because you feel such a need to be powerful,  you feel a lot of shame about the victim, and that's the thing that's really maybe the  most detrimental because you can't see yourself in shame. She herself felt an  incredible amount of shame. It's just that myth. It's that thing of, well, if a woman gets  raped, and if a woman gets heard, it's because she asked for it.  \n\nCM: It's also very Catholic and very Mexican, both of which I am. All the stuff that  you're saying, for me, it's just is so cultural too. Women are thought of particularly  around sexuality, so it's just like the clicks are phenomenon.  \n\nAmy: It's the kind of thing where you felt, so there's that real deep, deep, deep little  well of shame in there that when you start feeling like, \"Hey, I am a really strong  woman. I'm an incredible person. I am a divine warrior.\" That little voice goes, \"Oh  yes. Well, I'll tell you another thing. You are a real complete, total fucked up person.  You were victimized to prove it. On top of it sweetheart, it's going to happen again.\"  \nIt's that thing too. \"Don't let anybody get too close,\" because that goes right into the  lover thing. Here, if there's a person who really loves you and a woman who really  wants to give to you and really wants to totally accept you, then that voice comes up  and says, \"Oh yes, she's going to accept your shame, too.\" It's that feeling of like, \"I  can't let her in. I can't let her close because if she sees she'll be repulsed.\" She'll just  look at you and go, \"Oh, [unintelligible 00:53:39]. How can I love that?\" There's that  hedge. It's that little wall you put around yourself and say, \"Oh no, oh no.\" It feels  very virtuous because it feels like, \"Well, I'm doing it for your own good.\"  \n\nIt's like, \"I know I'm a shamed woman, so I can't let you share my shame.\" Yet it's so  bullshit. As you said, it's so cultural. It's what we women have been experiencing for  centuries. eons. Also coming from where you've come from with the Catholicism and with the Mexican culture and then putting it on top of all the karma, it's right there,  and yet what this is saying is that you've just got to break through it. It's really  important for you to realize that you cannot feel ashamed of yourself. See, what  happens is then it gets twisted, and you start feeling ashamed of the power. \n\nInstead of feeling like, \"How can I be ashamed of being a victim? Hey, this is  something I bought into, and I'm not going to buy into it anymore.\" Then what  happens is that voice says, \"Oh, and you should be ashamed of the fact that you're  powerful too. What about all the women who aren't powerful?\" How dare you? How  dare you rub their faces in it? Then you feel like, \"Oh God. Nothing really that terrible  and horrible and disgusting has happened to me and I somehow escaped in this  lifetime.\" Well, it should happen to me, so I should feel ashamed that it hasn't  happened to me as fully as it could.\"  \n\nIt's really getting you both coming and going. That's why it's so important for you to  really release the shame and really allow yourself to feel good about the fact that you  are protected, that you are meant to be a warrior, that you are meant to experience  that power, and that you do not have to be victimized ever again in this lifetime. You  will not be victimized ever again if you choose not to be.

The reason why this is coming up so strongly now is that you are starting about a six-year cycle. That is a very important cycle for you. It's like you started it  actually years ago. You started it about four years ago. You started this very important Saturn experience, and then you had a respite. You had a rest for about a  year, and now you're starting it again.  \n\nFirst Saturn in the sky as you know is continually moving. You happen to have all  this stuff back to back. As you can see, you have so many planets right here. Now  what happened is that you have Saturn, it passed over your 10th house. The 10th  house is the house of work, and Saturn rules work.  \n\nWhen Saturn passes through the 10th house, it says then that you really are  experiencing a real need to deal with your work energy. That was happening, I think  it was around '78. Let me just check. It started at 11 degrees of Leo. You started  experiencing it starting in September of '76, actually. You started experiencing it. It  continued until September of '79. That was over a three-year period. Then you had a  little bit of a respite. Then starting last September, so September of 1980, you  started experiencing it again very intensely, and you will continue experiencing it for  quite a while.  \n\nCM: Now, is that specifically around work again, or this is something [crosstalk]?  \n\nAmy: No, now it's something else. Okay? Now what you're experiencing is a number  of things because first of all, you have your sun in Libra. You also have Saturn in  Libra, and you have your ascendant in Libra. I know you have your ascendant in  Scorpio, excuse me, but your 12th house is ruled by Libra. Whenever Saturn passes  over the sun or Saturn or the 12th house, it creates a very deep experience. Now  your sun is in the same sign as your Saturn and your Saturn is in your 12th house.  It's like having three different cycles all back to back, all affecting you all at the same  time. That's a very intense energy for you. [crosstalk]  \n\nCM: It started in September?  \n\nAmy: It started in September. Now what it does is it affects you on all these different  level. First of all, it affects you with your sun. What it says is that you are then having  to confront all of your own limitations at this time, and you really have to deal with all  the limitations that you create inside of yourself. Also, you're in your Saturn return, and the Saturn cycle affects you in a lot of different ways.  \n\nFirst of all, one of the ways it affects you is that it really forces you to really let go of your childhood and to accept your adult energy so that all of a sudden, you, Cherrie,  are learning to be an adult in a total way. Now what that means is that you're  empowering yourself. You're really accepting your power and your identity on a  whole new level, on a level that you have never experienced before. It's saying then that you really need to deal with a lot of different issues with your Saturn cycle.  \n\nThe first issue is the issue of letting go of your childhood, which means that all of a  sudden, all these things that you have really associated with your childhood. All the  things that you haven't felt ready to deal with, you really have to deal with now. It's really connecting and confronting that energy. Really being able to look at it, really  being able to say, \"Yes, this is something that I really have to deal with. This is  something that I really have to connect to. This is something that I really have to  confront inside of myself.\" Now the second thing that's going on with this is the  realization that you also then have to deal with your work.  \n\nOne of the ways that we decide whether a person is an adult or not is by their work,  which is why obviously for so long women were never considered adults. [chuckles]  You are really looking at your work now and deciding what you're going to do with it. You've got three choices. Either what work you've been doing so far isn't your true  work, and now that you're in your Saturn cycle, you have to let go of it, and you have  to accept your true work, or you've just been doing something that was really right for  you, and it was your true work, but now it's changing, and you're accepting a new  energy because you're now going to another level, or what you've been doing has  been your true work, but now you're really broadening it and extending it and  experiencing it on a whole new level.  \n\nIt's saying that it's very, very, very important for you to really get in touch with  experiencing that transformational energy and knowing that now is a time for you to  let go of your past and to really accept your future. You do this in a number of ways.  First of all, the first step in the Saturn cycle is figuring out what you really don't want.  It's almost as if you're in there cleaning out your psychic closets and you're saying,  \"Okay, well, I don't need this anymore and I don't need this anymore and I don't need  this anymore. I really don't need to let go of this energy. I don't need to hold onto this  energy. I can let go of it. I am going to let go of it, and I'm really going to accept a  new energy deep inside of myself.\"  \n\nThe next step is figuring out what you really do want. That's harder because it comes  in dribs and drabs. It's learning how to be quiet enough and open enough to accept  that energy. It's learning how to say, \"Oh, okay, I've really got to learn how to accept  this energy. I've really got to be open to accepting this truth inside of myself and  knowing that this is exactly the right energy for myself.\"  \n\nIt's slowly and surely getting in touch with the energy and learning how to be open to  that energy in a really good way. Now the third thing that happens with the Saturn  cycle is because the etheric body of adulthood, consciousness of adulthood is  actually connecting to your real physical body. You're really changing your  connection to other people who used to be adults to you. Your connection to your  parents can change because they're no longer your parents. It's like you are now an  adult. You are peers now.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Upbringing","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3436,3894"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"10th House: Placements in the 10th House refer to notions of life purpose, success, and social acknowledgement.

Children don't die. Even when they're  dying, they don't die. It's because they don't have a real sense of their mortality, but  adults die. All of a sudden, now, you're really confronting that mortality, and you're  grieving for the loss of your childhood. It's really easy in your Saturn cycle to  experience a great deal of grief, and you've just got to let it come right through you.  Also, you're grieving for the death of your parents no matter what shape your parents  are in. Whether they're alive or not, whether they're healthy or not, you're going to  grieve for their death because they're no longer your parents. \n\nYou realize that you are an adult, they're adults, they are dying. That's a real intense  energy for people to deal with. Another thing that happens is that you really have to  deal with your own insecurity because being in your Saturn cycle, it's really, really  easy to feel insecure. It's that feeling of like, \"Oh, everything's changing. I'm in a  kaleidoscope now. I want everything to be the same. I want everything to be secure,  and yet, somehow it isn't.\" One of the things you're really working on is you're really  allowing yourself to break through that insecurity. You're really, really allowing  yourself to know what it is that you have to do.  \n\nYou're really being able to say, \"Okay, I know that what it is that I have to do is really  accept the truth inside of myself. I know that what I have to do is really be able to  know that my only security is my truth, is my destiny, and I can't try to pin it on  anything else.\" It is an insecure time. It is a painful time, but it's also a time of  releasing the past and accepting your true identity.  \n\nNow the fact that Saturn will soon be moving through your 12th house. Right now, it's  still in your 11th house. It's a little bit of a respite, and it will start getting into your  12th house. Let's see, it has to hit 13 degrees. It'll be in your 12th house by your-- let's see, is it by [unintelligible 01:05:55]? No, it's by next October. It's October of  '81. It'll go back into your 12th house.  \n\nStarting in October of '81, you're going to feel as if circumstances are forcing you to  release negative energy, to release your limitations. It's almost as if this really strong  force comes down into you and takes this really high-powered flashlight, and is  looking in all the corners and under the bed and in the closets and saying, \"Okay,  now you got to really deal with this shit. You've got to really deal with this shit,\" yet it  affects you outwardly, externally.  \n\nAs an example, one person I knew who was going through this. Her lover was  someone she really didn't want to be with yet she was really holding onto it because  she didn't want to hurt her lover's feelings. Then when Saturn was in her 12th house,  her lover said, \"I don't want to be with you anymore.\" At first, of course, the woman  was feeling really frustrated and really angry.  \n\nThen she realized what a fool she was. It was like, \"Oh God, I feel relieved.\" This is  what you really wanted. It's that kind of energy where sometimes things happen, and  yet when they happen, at first, you might feel a real frustration or a real anger, but  then you realize it's exactly what you want it to happen. It's this thing of like, \"Oh, I'm  so pleased. I'm so thankful that this happened. Now I don't have to carry it anymore.\"  \n\nRealize it's starting in October of '81, you will be going through this period of time in  which external circumstances are forcing you to grow, and yet you know that that is  the best thing that could happen to you. You realize that all the things that are  happening, they're the things that you really wanted to happen, and yet at the time, it  might feel very scary to you and might feel very difficult to you. It's really getting in  touch with accepting that energy and knowing that that is absolutely the right thing  and that you really can accept it-  \n\n[END OF AUDIO]","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Transit","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Family","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7#t=3894,4163"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/astrology_reading_with_cherrié_moraga_and_angie_arrien_undated/canvas/7/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Placements in the 12th House refer to mysticism, shifts in states of being or awareness, and (voluntary or involuntary) isolation.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.
