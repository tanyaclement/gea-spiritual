This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there's a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she's looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She's looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from. She is the only one in the royalty cards that looks towards the past.\n\n\n\nSG: Is that right?\n\n\n\nGA: Ah-ha. The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it's a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?\n\n\n\nSG: mmhmm! I realize that.\n\n\n\nGA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you're going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She's wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what's going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet. She's like real centered, content, she knows what she wants, she knows herself and she's just like emotionally there.\n\n\n\nSG: Good! Good.\n\n\n\nGA: Basically the message is to do something aesthetically pleasing about your surroundings and take care of your health and also maybe go out and buy a dress or cut your hair.

This bridge is a kind of bridging here that keeps you is keeping you broad-minded but that’s kind of–is a tendency in you to be kind of narrow-minded\n\n\n\nGA:\n I’m very stuffy and narrow-minded and picky about the people that I want to be lovers with and stuff.\n\n\n\nCS:\n Hmm! So maybe that’s what’s showing up here. You have some relationship lines coming in here. See it looks like one towards the end of your life that’s that’s a marriage it looks pretty good, and then another one in the middle of your life that looks…that’s all there already in marked in your hand.\n\n\n\nGA:\n hmm…Wow\n\n\n\nCS:\n This one in the end of your life looks like it’s a real positive, \"up\" relationship, and the other one looks like you go through a lot of shit together.\n\n\n\nGA:\n Yeah, I think this line must be me and Randy. We had real hard times. This one. I don’t know who the other one is.\n\n\n\nCS:\n You haven’t met them yet.\n\n\n\nGA:\n So there’s only two lines?\n\n\n\nCS:\n Well, there could be more coming in. The lines are always changing, you know? More come, some come, some go.\n\n\n\nGA:\n And what are the ones that are like this?\n\n\n\nCS:\n I don’t really know how to read those. They’re not good enough to discern which things mean stuff and which things don’t. I think that’s all that I can do.\n\n\n\nGA:\n That’s very good.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Relationships","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Sexuality","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Marriage Lines","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/che_reads_my_palms_santa_cruz_ca_10_july_1983/canvas/3#t=1350,1472"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/che_reads_my_palms_santa_cruz_ca_10_july_1983/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"CS:\n Let’s see the other one just one more time.

You've chosen to come into a family where there would be a lot of complicated issues for you to deal with. It’s enabled you to love a great deal more and in more complexity, but you still have a lot of stuff to work out about love. You have more of a capacity to love now than you did before. But that’s still something you’re kind of stopped at. You are much stronger–you’ve been forced to develop a willpower that enables you to go beyond yourself, and it's caused you to have a lot of experiences which are going to affect every aspect of your life but you have a very strong mind and will power. And actually your health is much better, your constitution, because of the changes that you’ve made in your life and family.
