She is ruled by Aries, and there's a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she's looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She's looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from.

Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health.

This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility.

Because this represents your karmic link, both of you are getting ready to-- I guess to exhibit new parts of your personality that working through these things has freed. That you can now be more yourself, that you can be a new part of yourself that you hadn't been able to be with her, because you've worked through all these things.\n\n\n\nThe long braids go all the way to the ground, which again, like the staff with the diamond at the end, represent bringing to earth, achieving, completing, manifesting. The braids are sort of tight on top and then more loose on the bottom. It's sort of like a symbol for the tightness of the structure of, I guess the relationship with the karmic link. You know like, I'm loosening it up a little, and the braids are coming undone.\n\n\n\nThe other symbol for earthing is the pedestal, because she's touching the pedestal with her body, and it goes all the way to the ground, and that is a symbol like the staff. Anything that goes from above to below means bringing down energy, manifesting, earthing. She's holding a yin-yang symbol in her disk, in her hand. The yin-yang symbol is vertical, so it means interchange. When it's horizontal, it means change in the environment. Vertical means inner.\"\n\n\n\nSG: Inside ourselves or inside the relationship?\n\n\n\nGA: Inside the karmic link between the two of you. I guess it's inside both of you, since both of you make the link. Disks is the symbol for the wheel of fortune also, for you've got things in control. You've got a handle on it. This represents, again, the disks, health, external environment, and money, abundance. It's the earth symbol. She's a very unusual lady, because look at her eyes. She's sort of like three-dimensional. I don't know.\n\n\n\nSG: The eyes remind me of the queen in Snow White. She reminds me of the wicked stepmother, actually. What's the background Gloria?\n\n\n\nGA: Would you like some--?\n\n\n\nSG: Yes, I would love. What's the background? Is it mountains?\n\n\n\nGA: Yes, she's walked through the mountains. It's been a long, hard struggle, a journey. She's gone through the dark forest.\n\n\n\nSG: Is that still a cloak? Is all that still the cloak that she's got there?\n\n\n\nGA: That's part of the snake.\n\n\n\nSG: Is that still a snake?\n\n\n\nGA: That means that the regenerative powers are very great, transformative powers. Either it means that you're going to give birth to a project that's financially rewarding, or you're going to give birth to a new identity. Since the question is about the karmic link, it seems to me that the new identity applies, but I'm not sure.\n\n\n\nSG: That's good. For sure it's not financial. [laughs] I don't see that at all. It must be the other.\n\n\n\nGA: Yes. She looks a little tired. It's been a long haul.\n\n\n\nSG: Mm-hmm. That's good.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Disks","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/gloria_tarot_for_sally_gearhart_14_may_1981_box_157_30_mp3_62/canvas/1#t=1253,1610"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/gloria_tarot_for_sally_gearhart_14_may_1981_box_157_30_mp3_62/canvas/1/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: Okay.

Am I taking too long?\n\n\n\nGA: No, this is the usual. These three cards I use to tie in. This is the nine of disks and its game. It's ruled by-- It's a card of Libra, I'm Libra. Venus and Virgo, which is my card because my Venus is in Virgo. Okay, the woman that made the cards was named Frieda Harris. She had a very unusual relationship with Crowley in that they weren't lovers or anything, but they had a very close bond. Crowley was lovers with Ricardie at that time. Ricardie was very, very jealous. Very, very jealous of Crowley's relationship with Frieda Harris. Frieda Harris realized it was a karmic thing she had going with Crowley. She had no power in the relationship. The only thing she could do was represent it in the cards, so she did this.\n\nThere's a card-- a coin to represent each of the three. She had, one of her pet names for Crowley was the king. One of his pet names for her was the queen, or the princess or something like that. Anyway, she put Ricardie and Crowley up here showing that their relationship had prominence. It was more important. That her thing was synthesizing the information she was getting from Crowley and putting it into the cards. Her thing was resolving all these past life karma and stuff. She really knew that hers was not the most important relationship. It was very difficult for her. Very very difficult for her. She had suffered great pain.\n\nThis card she named Gain, because she had gained from this experience. It's a very-- If you look at it carefully, there's a picture of a bullseye and hitting the mark and she did that, and that's how she saw her relationship with Crowley despite all of the things. What this card represents is your receptivity, the feminine nature of, aspect of your nature, how you receive information, is very much on the mark, very much. You're very much able to do it.\n\nIf you center yourself and concentrate on it, you can get there. You can make a bullseye or whatever it's called.
