This is the queen of disks. This is the lesbian card in this deck. One of the lesbian cards in this deck. She is ruled by Aries, and there's a ram in the picture and that represents moving forward in a new direction. There are horns on her head that extend way out. That means she's looking at the past which is this desert type with an oasis in it, and she is ready to do something about beautifying her environment right now. Make it more statically pleasing. The past is a lesson that-- A process. She's looking at the past to see what she did so that the present could be made more beautiful and it can be learned from. She is the only one in the royalty cards that looks towards the past.\n\n\n\nSG: Is that right?\n\n\n\nGA: Ah-ha. The horns extend way out, and anything that extends out from the head in symbology represents a large consciousness, enlightenment. For example, you mentioned the star card, her hair goes all the way to the ground. That means enlightenment, consciousness stretched, growth. Helmets in this-- the Hierophant which is your second card and Again in the third card, the princess of disks has the horns. Anything people wear on their heads, helmets, hair, that means it's a process of expanding consciously in your head.\n\nShe represents the disks which is a card about external reality, finances and health. In this respect she might be looking at, and you in this case might be looking at how-- not only the health of your body but also the health of the relationship in terms of with Jane. You are wanting to bring to earth certain ideas about maybe cleaning up your surroundings emotionally and also physically and it's a step with the diamond and the diamond is also another symbol for external reality for money, for earth, for manifesting. This is a symbol of bringing the power to earth or centering, manifesting whatever you want to call that.\n\nThe vegetation in the background represents the fertility. Here is a desert with a little oasis, so what you want to do is you want to make the relationship more fertile. The pineapple is a symbol of fertility. Also, the goddess. Do you see the pineapple right here?\n\n\n\nSG: mmhmm! I realize that.\n\n\n\nGA: She is wearing a vest of, made of little coins. That means you're going to have abundance. They do have the potential to have an abundance in health and also in material wellbeing with Jane, and with the other people that you relate to. She's wearing two bracelets. In ancient Egypt if you had one bracelet it meant something. If you had two, it meant something else. If you had one up here, it meant-- They designated that the hierarchy of the teachers or how evolved the teachers were, so here both risks have bracelets. This is a highly evolved card. Mature, Very mature. Very aware of what's going on and also very centered and very tranquil, and nothing is going to sweep her off her feet. She's like real centered, content, she knows what she wants, she knows herself and she's just like emotionally there.\n\n\n\nSG: Good! Good.\n\n\n\nGA: Basically the message is to do something aesthetically pleasing about your surroundings and take care of your health and also maybe go out and buy a dress or cut your hair.

She's a very good astrologer. She's a Sag with a moon in Pisces. She's a lovely person, and she's really good. She teaches here and there. She's good. I would recommend her, because I'm not doing it. I have evenings where I get into it. I sat down and gave Meg and Julia an astrology class for two hours one morning. It was really fun.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Did they like that?\n\n\n\nLB\n: Yeah, they loved it. [unintelligible 00:14:41] Anyway, in the astrology class we were talking about the different ages. You know that term of going into the age of Aquarius? Each one is 2,000 years long. We were talking about that-- and they go backwards. It's the age we're in is Pisces now, going to Aquarius, and before that was Aries and before that was Taurus. It's interesting in terms of when you think about-- The Arian age was Greek and Roman, the barbarians and everybody killing everybody, else which is very Aries stuff, the age of the heroes. Then Pisces is the age of the martyrs. We were thinking about all this stuff.\n\n\n\nGA\n: Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nLB\n: Yes. Taurus astrologically would make sense.

I’m a left-handed person even though I write with my right hand.\n\n\n\nCS:\n And when you grab for something, do you grab with your left hand?\n\n\n\nGA:\n Um, up until it broke. I was doing most of the things with my left hand but then I broke this arm so then I started doing things with this right hand.\n\n\n\nCS:\n So would you tell me that you’re left handed or right handed?\n\n\n\nGA:\n Right now I’m right handed but naturally I’m ambidextrous.

What’s written on your left hand is the markings of your spirit, the things that your spirit needed to work out, the things that your spirit wanted to work out. It’s a marking of the progression you’ve made up until this point–your spirit has made up until this point. The markings on your right hand, or the hand that you use the most, is the marking–marks the progression that you’ve made in this life.\n\n\n\nGA:\n Okay do it on the left.\n\n\n\nCS:\n Left being what you came in with…\n\n\n\nGA:\n Yes\n\n\n\nGA:\n And this is what I am now.\n\n\n\nCS:\n Okay…","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Ambidexterity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Health","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Karma","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Past Lives","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/che_reads_my_palms_santa_cruz_ca_10_july_1983/canvas/3#t=123,262"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/che_reads_my_palms_santa_cruz_ca_10_july_1983/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Handwriting Analysis | Location: Box: 5 | Folder: 8","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/che_reads_my_palms_santa_cruz_ca_10_july_1983/canvas/3#t=123,262"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/che_reads_my_palms_santa_cruz_ca_10_july_1983/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"CS:\n Um…okay.
