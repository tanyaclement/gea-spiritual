There are people who actually do that. Where am I at? Oh yes, you're around a square. Let me look at my notes on this for one second.

You have absolutely no tolerance for boredom or for conservatism in the strict sense of the people who are interested in making it like they think it was three days ago.

It really doesn't.\n\nGA: In friendships too. I like to shake them up.\n\nLB: Oh, yes, it's a real shake-them-up energy. Aquarians are like this in general because they're ruled by that planet, but Aquarians always have this thing, they love to say things that are going to make everybody's jaw drop. They figure it's good for everybody to have their ideas shaken up periodically, and you have that also, of the sense of always wanting to figure out the thing that no one has thought of, that's going to--People getting their set images of the world, or set ways of thinking or whatever, you're the person who's always looking for the little something that's going to shift the way everything looks, that's going to turn the world upside down.

There wasn't a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way.

You're immediately wanting to shake it all off and start all over, which can be a problem. I would worry about it more if it was square.

There's this whole thing about discipline and ritual, very-\n\nGloria Anazaldúa: Sí.\n\nLB: -sort of regular setting up rituals for yourself that help you channel your energy is a very critical thing in your life.\n\nGA: It is [crosstalking].\n\nLB: It's part of your path, basically. We'll get into that when I talk about your North node. \n\nGA: OK.\n\nLB: Anyway, but basically, aside from that Virgo stuff going on, it's mostly air and fire, which is very self-expressive. Self-expression in the sense of there's a real need to put yourself out there in some way. You hate feelings of restriction. \n\nGA: Oh yeah.\n\nLB: The energy is very much going out, wants to go out all the time. Whereas the earth and water are much more self-contained, sort of gathering in energy.\n\nGA: Any kind of limitations on me, I can't stand it.\n\nLB: Yes, well, there's a lot of stuff in here about how you could never do a nine-to-five job if your life depended on it. It's just not in the cards.\n\nGA: I know, I've done it, but I can't--I just can't! [laughs]\n\nLB: When I was looking up stuff in your chart, it was funny, there's about four different things in it say forget the nine-to-five jobs circuit. Everything in your chart says, \"No way.\" It's also a particular kind of playfulness to both those, more so than the other ones. Earth and water tend to be a little more somber and a little more-- Everything is gathered in. Can't remember the difference between centripetal and centrifugal, but the one that goes out is air and fire, and the one that sort of gathers in is earth and water, and you're heavy on air and fire. It's good that you have that earth in there, because otherwise you'd be a little too unfocused.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac element","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Identity","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Career","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/natal_chart_for_gea_by_liza_biow_brooklyn_05_june_1983/canvas/5#t=90,235"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/natal_chart_for_gea_by_liza_biow_brooklyn_05_june_1983/canvas/5/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Elements: \"The twelve signs of the zodiac refelct three qualities in each of the four elements in the form of fire, air, earth, and water signs.\"\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

Even good stuff can be completely overwhelming because you've got everybody's.\n\nGA: Then I tend to go the opposite way, to become callous, just in self-protection.

There's also, one of the things that people with that kind of stuff tend to do is withdraw into a real fantasy world. I have a moon in Pisces, a really strong moon in Pisces, which is similar stuff.

There wasn't a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way.

Then you have a fair amount of emphasis on mutable with the Virgo. You have the Venus in Virgo and your midheaven in Virgo and Sag rising. The mutable is distributive. It's wanting to make the connections between everything, whichever element it's in.\n\nWhile Sag, in particular, is a lot that way of making the connections between philosophical ideas. It's a lot more communication and sort of putting the stuff out there in a way. The cardinal is the initiation and then the fixed is the consolidating whatever that particular element is. Then you get to the mutable, which is spreading it around in the world. You're big on starting it and spreading it around the world, and you have a little bit trouble of just sort of [unintelligible 00:06:19] [crosstalk]--\n\nGA: Yes, let somebody else finish it.\n\n[laughter]\n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Mode","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Pluto","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Element","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Writing","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Venus","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/natal_chart_for_gea_by_liza_biow_brooklyn_05_june_1983/canvas/5#t=145,381"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/natal_chart_for_gea_by_liza_biow_brooklyn_05_june_1983/canvas/5/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Modes/Qualities: \"Within the four elements, astrology differentiates three qualities: cardinal (impulse-giving), fixed (impulse-receiving), and mutable (flexible).\"\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

The grass is alive.\n\nLB: Right, that kind of stuff. It could be really agonizing on some level to be that in tune with what's going on. This is the problem with people with strong Neptune things is you're so aware of everyone's pain or everyone's whatever that you can't deal with it. It's like having skin of parchment or something. You're feeling everything's pain and everybody's pain and everybody's whatever. Even good stuff can be completely overwhelming because you've got everybody's.\n\nGA: Then I tend to go the opposite way, to become callous, just in self-protection. [laughs]\n\nLB: You never really manage very well to be callous, I imagine. Probably callous by your standards is not callous by other people's standards. There's also, one of the things that people with that kind of stuff tend to do is withdraw into a real fantasy world. I have a moon in Pisces, a really strong moon in Pisces, which is similar stuff. It works in a different way than mine, because yours is much more connected with your sun, which means in some ways that you have a hard time getting a handle on who the hell you are.\n\nEspecially when you were a kid, I imagine, had a really hard time figuring out who you were and what you wanted to do in the world and what your sense of purpose was or what your own value was, even, because, first of all, it was really difficult for you to separate out yourself from everything else around. There wasn't a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way. If you feel like you're unequipped to deal with the world. Everyone else seems to wander around not getting upset about the grass, and [unintelligible 00:24:01]\n\nGA: Yes, I couldn't believe these people. I hope you have a pen, because I don't have any cartridges.\n\nLB: Yes, I do.

There are people who actually do that. Where am I at? Oh yes, you're around a square. Let me look at my notes on this for one second.

It really doesn't.\n\nGA: In friendships too. I like to shake them up.\n\nLB: Oh, yes, it's a real shake-them-up energy. Aquarians are like this in general because they're ruled by that planet, but Aquarians always have this thing, they love to say things that are going to make everybody's jaw drop.

I can buy that to a certain extent, but she sees the midheaven as the symbol of where you fit, where you fall in the Earth or how you are related to the Earth as a planet and where you are in relation to this global community.\n\nGA: Sort of like your destiny.\n\nLB: Yes, but it's your location on this planet as opposed to just you as some sort of abstract.

It's also because of your Saturn is retrograde, which is different, but it also has to do with not being very well defended against the world, psychically. Especially with sun conjunct Neptune.

The grass is alive.\n\nLB: Right, that kind of stuff. It could be really agonizing on some level to be that in tune with what's going on.

There's also, one of the things that people with that kind of stuff tend to do is withdraw into a real fantasy world. I have a moon in Pisces, a really strong moon in Pisces, which is similar stuff.

There wasn't a sense of you as a separate entity, because you felt so connected to everything. One of the things that happens a lot with the sun-Neptune stuff is real insecurity in a certain way.
