Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\nLB: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world.

It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff. Whereas Neptune is much more diffuse.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Career","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Health","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Neptune","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Spiritual Practice","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=230,570"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: Do you know if Scorpio is going to go into Scorpio in the next [crosstalk]? \n\nLB: Yes, and it's a very heavy astrological thing.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

That is sometimes a little bit at war with your [crosstalk] the  lever, which is very into harmony and your sense of beauty and harmony and  balance and all that stuff. Is a little bit at war with the emotional nature, which jumps  right into everything. \n\nThis is what I think right now, and this is what's true right now, and who cares if it  balances out anything and this is, whatever. There's little tension between those two.  Also, that sometimes your immediate emotional reactions to things can cloud your  intellectual clarity.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline.

It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\nLB: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

You have to react instantly and it has a lot-- Your  style of how you learn to get by in the world when you were young, it's sometimes  real and applicable when you're older, so it can be a problem. It's also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn't really get rolling until you're older. People  are much more like their moons when you're kids. \n\nYou grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it's much more, you have no power and you're in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger. \n\nGA: I'm much better in crises. \n\nLB: It's a great one for crises. I have a terrible moon for crisis. Well, it  depends. If it's the kind of thing where somebody else is in trouble, I'm great  because it's empathy, but I've been in a situation where people-- I had a guy back  me into the corner and be ready to rape me and I'm sitting there empathizing, it's  like, \"You can be useless.\" If somebody else is in trouble and fine, I'm in trouble. I  would [inaudible 00:38:02] but it's interesting. I always fascinated watching people  who I know really well, and so I've seen them go through like real heavy, \"All right,  now we have to deal with something real fast.\" \n\nIt's like you just see them absolutely clear. You would be real fast right on there.  Your only problem's you might react too fast to things without thinking. There \nwouldn't be any time lag and you wouldn't get thrown. You could like get right into it  and deal with [inaudible 00:38:36]. It's a real different chart [inaudible 00:38:52] \n\nGA: Oh, yes. \n\nLB: Virgo, Scorpio [inaudible 00:38:54] \n\nGA: Woo, heavy.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

We know it's going to happen in the next four years and to try and imagine  how you can prepare for this is overwhelming, but I'm sort of psyched. [laughter] I  think it'll be real interesting. Anyway, that's the generational stuff. The third planet  sun house-- Planet that's connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It's like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It's like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.\n\nGA: Wow. \n\nLB: Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it's  very disorienting, and it's very exciting. It's not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It's much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It's exciting, and  it's sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It's like when you're doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That's Uranus, obviously. \n\nUranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There's a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Pluto","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=863,1025"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus represents change, revolution, independence, and individual power.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs.

What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over.

Then Pisces is the age of the martyrs. We were thinking about all this stuff.\n\nGA: Jesus Christ.\n\nLB: Yes. Taurus astrologically would make sense.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes. Really and that depends on other aspects. Depends on what you do with  it.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Astrological Aspect","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,230"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Title: Astrological and I Ching readings | Location:  Box:  5 | Folder:  4","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Location","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Notes","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=0,0"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"GA: I don't think I use my time well because I get tired. \n\nLB: Yes, and also your tendency is to jump into things, sometimes. Work  real, real hard and burn out. It is a burnout aspect altogether, tremendous amounts  of energy. You really do have tremendous amounts of energy, but you can have  trouble disciplining it. Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

You have to react instantly and it has a lot-- Your  style of how you learn to get by in the world when you were young, it's sometimes  real and applicable when you're older, so it can be a problem. It's also real  interesting because how people react to dangerous or very upsetting traumatic  situations, they fall back on their moon instantly. Your sun is very much more your  ego and your sense of self and it doesn't really get rolling until you're older. People  are much more like their moons when you're kids. \n\nYou grow into your sun and your ascendant more when you have some sort of  control over your life and you can start acting on your own sense of self. Before that  it's much more, you have no power and you're in a position of reacting to the world  and adapting to the world. The moon is much stronger. \n\nGA: I'm much better in crises. \n\nLB: It's a great one for crises. I have a terrible moon for crisis. Well, it  depends. If it's the kind of thing where somebody else is in trouble, I'm great  because it's empathy, but I've been in a situation where people-- I had a guy back  me into the corner and be ready to rape me and I'm sitting there empathizing, it's  like, \"You can be useless.\" If somebody else is in trouble and fine, I'm in trouble. I  would [inaudible 00:38:02] but it's interesting. I always fascinated watching people  who I know really well, and so I've seen them go through like real heavy, \"All right,  now we have to deal with something real fast.\" \n\nIt's like you just see them absolutely clear. You would be real fast right on there.  Your only problem's you might react too fast to things without thinking. There \nwouldn't be any time lag and you wouldn't get thrown. You could like get right into it  and deal with [inaudible 00:38:36]. It's a real different chart [inaudible 00:38:52] \n\nGA: Oh, yes. \n\nLB: Virgo, Scorpio [inaudible 00:38:54] \n\nGA: Woo, heavy.

Of the different planets, all the different aspects of  your own energy, and how to use it, and different parts of yourself. How those are related to each other. Whether there's a smooth connection between things, or they'll clash. \n\nGloria Anzaldúa: That's what is meant by bad aspect or good aspect? \n\nLB: Right. \n\nGA: People use that. \n\nLB: That's a lousy way to put it because it's not a matter of bad. There's  the harmonious and the unharmonious aspects. The harmonious ones are the trines and the sextiles. The disharmonious ones are the squares and the oppositions, and conjunctions are neutral. \n\nAlso, the [unintelligible 00:00:53] is a little bit difficult.  Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings. Anyway, that's basically-- There's also, in terms of the different aspects,  very briefly, the conjunction is the two planets above, and the conjunction are just  very much connected to each other, and they feed each other tremendously in some way. Anyway, men need to strengthen each other. \n\nGA: Like my Sun and Mars. \n\nLB: [unintelligible 00:03:06].\n\nGA: I know, that's funny that they should be together because that's a lot of force. \n\nLB: It's a lot of force. Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Spreading it out over time, conserving it and then-- \n\nGA: I've been working to do that for years, to get that kind of discipline. It's  been a lot of work. \n\nLB: Even just physically, of saying, \"Okay I've done enough for today,\" and  stopping, so you're not wiped out for the next week, but it's also wonderful in terms of  just-- It lends a certain fierceness and physical charge to your sense of what you  want to do in the world. When you decide you want to do something, the energy is  there. It's not like you have to work to get motivated on stuff, [crosstalk] the  discipline.\n\nGA: Yes, well what does the fact that Neptune is also so close to that, what  does that mean? \n\nLB: Neptune has conjuncture Sun, it's not really, well loosely conjuncture Mars. Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs. It's in fantasy, getting lost in fantasy. \n\nGA: I've done drugs. \n\nLB: Yes, it's a drug thing. It's such an incredible craving for mystical stuff  that if you have trouble finding them in your real life, you tend to create it artificially. \n\nGA: I think I do that too. \n\nLB: Yes, but yes, a real rich fantasy life. What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over. It's  very much about upheaval in terms of formation and real, powerful, concentrated,  overwhelming stuff.

We know it's going to happen in the next four years and to try and imagine  how you can prepare for this is overwhelming, but I'm sort of psyched. [laughter] I  think it'll be real interesting. Anyway, that's the generational stuff. The third planet  sun house-- Planet that's connected with spiritual stuff I think is Uranus, which is very  fast. It's like flash of light. The way the images was, Neptune is like the ocean to me.  It's like a tidal wave. Pluto is a volcano, and Uranus is a lightning bolt.\n\nGA: Wow. \n\nLB: Very fast, your world turns upside down. Whenever this heavy Uranus  stuff goes on, everything just gets turned on its head. It happens very fast, and it's  very disorienting, and it's very exciting. It's not like the slow rumble of Pluto. It's much  more like zap. Forget everything you learn [unintelligible 00:14:31] It's exciting, and  it's sort of like speaking in tongues kind of thing. Something hits you and you know  something. It's like when you're doing something and, all of a sudden, you just know  something. You have no idea where you know it from. That's Uranus, obviously. \n\nUranus is the planet right after Saturn. Saturn has a lot to do with your self-concept,  but your self-concept in terms of your own limitations, your idea of this is where I  stop. Like your structure in a sometimes positive way, but in also a very limiting way.  There's a certain rigidity involved in Saturn. Wherever Saturn falls, and whatever the  aspects are, whatever issues are going on with Saturn for you are, the things that  you really need to work out in order to move on to spiritual stuff in a lot of ways. \n","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Transcript","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Plática","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Zodiac","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Pluto","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Saturn","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3#t=863,1025"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://tanyaclement.github.io/gea-spiritual/lisa_biow_astrology_reading_new_haven_03_january_1982/canvas/3/page2","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Uranus represents change, revolution, independence, and individual power.\n\nBanzhaf, Hajo, and Anna Haebler.

Actually, it's probably better, probably the easiest way-- I think the best way to think  about them is fluid and difficult, or fluid and stressful. \n\nConjunction is neutral, although it's a very powerful aspect, it's not really one way or  the other. A lot depends on other aspects that are going on, and when the  placements are, and that kind of thing. Anyway, the reason why I don't like to think of  them in terms of good or bad is, people who have-- I've seen charts of people who  have all trines and sextiles, and it doesn't work out very well. It can, depending what  your life is about and what you want to be doing. \n\nThings come so easy that it's hard to really move to another plane with anything  because you're not challenged. You don't run up against a block that makes you jump to something higher. Squares and oppositions make you do that, it's like some  war with yourself that generates a tremendous amount of energy. \n\nGA: That makes sense.\n\nLB: That can give you an amazing amount of [unintelligible 00:02:07] to  do something, but [crosstalk] \n\nGA: You have to be dissatisfied with something before you would want to change it. \n\nLB: Right, and also the sparks, the clash. \n\nGA: They're both necessary. \n\nLB: That's why I don't like to look at it, it's more like challenges and  blessings.

Yes, you have a lot of energy to do stuff. When I say it's neutral, that's the most neutral of the aspects, in that it's a tremendous amount of energy, a lot of initiative, a lot of, \"\"This is what I want,\"\" and then they go do it, stuff.  Which can be, depending on how you use that, can be wonderful, or can lead to real  rashness, jumping into things too fast, being oblivious to other people's needs  sometimes.

Sexually, it does make it as a conjunction. There's something called orbs, which is the amount of variance off the exact angle that you still count as that angle.  They're different for the different aspects, and they're also different depending on  which planets they are. Also, different astrologists disagree on how much  [unintelligible 00:05:43] on that. Usually, you allow a larger orb when it's one of the  inner planets, it's one of the outer planets. The inner planets being anything from  Saturn on in, and the outer planets from Saturn on out. Neptune is one of the real-- It's too past Saturn and Mars as one. \n\nThis side of Saturn, so that would be a larger orb, and the conjunction is a pretty large  [unintelligible 00:06:08] 8 to 10 degrees. Anything which falls within 10 degrees of  each other, especially if it's with one of the lights, sun or the moon, or if it's inner and  an outer planet, [unintelligible 00:06:21] towards that. I don't know, it just  [unintelligible 00:06:25] settling phase. Actually no, I meant conjuncture, this is  almost 30, so [unintelligible 00:06:30] between 6 and more an 8, so it really is a  conjunction. Anyway, the Neptune-sun conjunction, Neptune is a lot of that psychic  stuff.\n\nHow that goes into your sun, is first of all, that's really connected to your sense of  self. There's two things going on. In some way, that kind of energy is connected with  your own identity and your own idea for who you are, and what you want to do in the  world. On the other hand, it's generally a pretty good indication of having some ability  in that area. Of having psychic resources that [unintelligible 00:07:14] into. \n\nGA: Well, I better start developing. \n\nLB: Yes, it's there. When you're looking for that psychic, spiritual. Spiritual is  not-- It is real spiritual, but it's different things on the chart that within it gets spiritual  kinds of energy, and all very different types. Neptunian type of spirituality is very  fluid, oceanic, and vague sometimes. It's the pitfalls with all the Neptunian stuff is  drugs.

What else with Neptune? By  contrast, something, Scorpio, eighth house, Pluto's type spirituality is a very different- - It's much more occult, much more overwhelming. Neptune is overwhelming in a  sense of drowning, but Pluto is like a volcano. It's more occult, it's more explosive.  Not fast explosive, but turn your life upside down, everything you ever thought is not  going to work anymore. Spirituality, throw it all out the window and start all over.
